Function: Euler
Section: transcendental
C-Name: mpeuler
Prototype: p
Help: Euler=Euler(): Euler's constant with current precision
Description: 
 ():real:prec	mpeuler(prec)
Doc: Euler's constant $\gamma=0.57721\cdots$. Note that
 \kbd{Euler} is one of the few special reserved names which cannot be used for
 variables (the others are \kbd{I} and \kbd{Pi}, as well as all function
 names).
 
 \syn{mpeuler}{\var{prec}} where $\var{prec}$ \emph{must} be given. Note that
 this creates $\gamma$ on the PARI stack, but a copy is also created on the
 heap for quicker computations next time the function is called.
