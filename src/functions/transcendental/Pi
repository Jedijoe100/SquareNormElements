Function: Pi
Section: transcendental
C-Name: mppi
Prototype: p
Help: Pi=Pi(): the constant pi, with current precision
Description: 
 ():real:prec	mppi(prec)
Doc: the constant $\pi$ ($3.14159\cdots$).
 
 \syn{mppi}{\var{prec}} where $\var{prec}$ \emph{must} be given. Note that
 this creates $\pi$ on the PARI stack, but a copy is also created on the heap
 for quicker computations next time the function is called.
