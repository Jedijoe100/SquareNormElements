Function: forell
Section: programming/control
C-Name: forell
Prototype: vVLLI
Help: forell(E,a,b,{seq}): execute seq for each elliptic curves E of conductor
 between a and b in the elldata database.
Doc: evaluates \var{seq}, where 
 the formal variable $E$ ranges through all elliptic curves of conductors from
 $a$ to $b$. Th \tet{elldata} database must be installed and contain data for
 the specified conductors.
