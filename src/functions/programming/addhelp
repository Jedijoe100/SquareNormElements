Function: addhelp
Section: programming/specific
C-Name: addhelp
Prototype: vrs
Help: addhelp(sym,str): add/change help message for the symbol sym.
Doc: changes the help message for the symbol \kbd{sym}. The string \var{str}
 is expanded on the spot and stored as the online help for \kbd{sym}. It is
 recommended to document global variables and user functions in this way,
 although \kbd{gp} will not protest if you don't.

 You can attach a help text to an alias, but it will never be
 shown: aliases are expanded by the \kbd{?} help operator and we get the help
 of the symbol the alias points to. Nothing prevents you from modifying the
 help of built-in PARI functions. But if you do, we would like to hear why you
 needed it!

 Without \tet{addhelp}, the standard help for user functions consists of its
 name and definition.
 \bprog
 gp> f(x) = x^2;
 gp> ?f
 f =
   (x)->x^2

 gp>
 @eprog\noindent
 You may include the definition of a user function in a help text,
 or the value of a user variable (meant to remain constant), as follows:
 \bprog
 gp> C = 2
 gp> addhelp(C, Str("Magic constant, C = ", C))
 gp> ?C
 Magic constant, C = 2

 gp> addhelp(f, Str("Square\n", f))
 gp> ?f
 Square
 (x)->x^2

 gp>
 @eprog\noindent Both constructions use the variable value at the time of the
 \kbd{addhelp} call. Changing the value later will not update the help text.
