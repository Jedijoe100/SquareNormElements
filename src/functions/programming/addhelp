Function: addhelp
Section: programming/specific
C-Name: addhelp
Prototype: vSs
Help: addhelp(S,str): add/change help message for the symbol S.
Doc: changes the help
 message for the symbol $S$. The string \var{str} is expanded on the spot
 and stored as the online help for $S$. If $S$ is a function \emph{you} have
 defined, its definition will still be printed before the message \var{str}.
 It is recommended that you document global variables and user functions in
 this way. Of course \kbd{gp} will not protest if you skip this.

 Nothing prevents you from modifying the help of built-in PARI
 functions. (But if you do, we would like to hear why you needed to do it!)
