Help: printf(fmt,{x}*): prints its arguments according to the format fmt
Description:
  (str,?gen,...):void  printf1("format\n"${2 format_args})
Doc: prints its arguments according to the format fmt, which specifies how
 subsequent arguments are converted for output. The format is a
 character string composed of zero or more directives:
 \item ordinary characters (not \kbd{\%}), printed unchanged, 
 \item conversions specifications (\kbd{\%} followed by some characters)
 which fetch one argument from the list and prints it according to the
 specification.
 
 More precisely, a conversion specification consists in a \%, one or more
 optional flags (among \kbd{\#}, \kbd{0}, \kbd{-}, \kbd{+}, ' '), an optional
 decimal digit string specifying a minimal field width, an optional precision
 in the form of a period ('\kbd{.}') followed by a decimal digit string, and
 the conversion specifier (among d,i, o, u, x,X, p, e,E, f, g,G, s, Z).

 \misctitle{The flag characters.} The character \kbd{\%} is followed by zero or
 more of the following flags:

 \item \kbd{\#} The value is converted to an ``alternate form''. For
 \kbd{o} conversion (octal), a 0 is prefixed to the string. For \kbd{x} and
 \kbd{X} conversions (hexa), respectively \kbd{0x} and \kbd{0X} are
 prepended. For other conversions, the flag is ignored.

 \item \kbd{0} The value should be zero padded. For 
 \kbd{d},
 \kbd{o},
 \kbd{u},
 \kbd{x},
 \kbd{X}
 \kbd{e},
 \kbd{E},
 \kbd{f},
 \kbd{g}, and
 \kbd{G} conversions, the value is padded on the left with zeros rather than
 blanks. (If the \kbd{0} and \kbd{-} flags both appear, the \kbd{0} flag is
 ignored.)

 \item \kbd{-} The value is left adjusted on the field boundary. (The
 default is right justification.) The value is padded on the right with
 blanks, rather than on hte left with blanks or zeros. A \kbd{-} overrides a
 \kbd{0} if both are given.

 \item \kbd{' '} (a space). A blank is left before a positive number
 produced by a signed conversion.

 \item \kbd{+} A sign (+ or -) is placed before a number produced by a
 signed conversion. A \kbd{+} overrideѕ a space if both are used.

 \misctitle{The field width} An optional decimal digit string (whose first
 digit is non­zero) specifying a \emph{minimum} field width. If the value has
 fewer characters than the field width, it is padded with spaces on the left
 (or right, if the left-adjusment flag has been given). In no case does a
 small field width cause truncation of a field; if the value is wider than
 the field width, the field is expanded to contain the conversion result.
 Instead of a decimal digit string, one may write \kbd{*} to specify that the
 field width is given in the next argument.

 \misctitle{The precision} An optional precision in the form of a period
 ('\kbd{.}') followed by a decimal digit string. This gives
 the number of digits to appear after the radix character for \kbd{e},
 \kbd{E}, \kbd{f}, and \kbd{F} conversions, the maximum number of significant
 digits for \kbd{g} and \kbd{G} conversions, and the maximum number of
 characters to be printed from an \kbd{s} conversion.
 Instead of a decimal digit string, one may write \kbd{*} to specify that the
 field width is given in the next argument.

 \misctitle{The length modifier} This is ignored under gp.

 \misctitle{The conversion specifier} A character that specifies the type of
 conversion to be applied.

 \item \kbd{d} A signed integer.

 \item \kbd{o}, \kbd{u}, \kbd{x}, \kbd{X} An unsigned integer, converted
 to unsigned octal (\kbd{o}), decimal (\kbd{u}) or hexadecimal (\kbd{x} or
 \kbd{X}) notation. The letters \kbd{abcdef} are used for \kbd{x}
 conversions;  the letters \kbd{ABCDEF} are used for \kbd{X} conversions.

 \item \kbd{e}, \kbd{E} The (real) argument is converted in the style
 \kbd{[+-]d.ddd e[+-]dd}, where there is one digit before the decimal point,
 and the number of digits after it is equal to the precision; if the
 precision is missing, use the current \kbd{realprecision} for the total
 number of printed digits.

 \item \kbd{f} The (real) argument is converted in the style
 \kbd{[+-]ddd.ddd}, where the number of digits after the decimal point
 is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, use the current 
 \kbd{realprecision} for the total number of printed digits.

 \item \kbd{g}, \kbd{G} The (real) argument is converted in style
 \kbd{e} or \kbd{f} (or \kbd{E} or \kbd{F} for \kbd{G} conversions)
 \kbd{[+-]ddd.ddd, where the total number of digits printed
 is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, use the current 
 \kbd{realprecision}. Style \kbd{e} is used when
 the binary exponent is $< -32$ (or to print \kbd{0.}), or when the integer
 part cannot be decided given the known significant digits, and the \kbd{f}
 format otherwise.

 \item \kbd{c} The integer argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the
 resulting character is written.

 \item \kbd{s} Convert to a character string. If a precision is given, no
 more than the specified number of characters are written.

 \item \kbd{p} Print the adress of the argument in hexadecimal (as if by
 \kbd{\%\#x}).

 \item \kbd{\%} A \kbd{\%} is written. No argument is converted. The complete
 conversion specification is \kbd{\%\%}.
