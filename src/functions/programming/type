Function: type
Section: programming/specific
C-Name: type0
Prototype: G
Help: type(x): return the type of the GEN x.
Description: 
 (gen):typ              typ($1)
Doc: this is useful only under \kbd{gp}. Returns the internal type name of
 the PARI object $x$ as a  string. Check out existing type names with the
 metacommand \b{t}. For example \kbd{type(1)} will return "\typ{INT}".
 
 \syn{type0}{\var{x}}, though the macro \kbd{typ} is usually simpler to use
 since it return an integer that can easily be matched with the symbols
 \typ{*}. The name \kbd{type} was avoided since it is a reserved identifier
 for some C(++) compilers.
