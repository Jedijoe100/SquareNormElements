Help: global(list of variables): declare the corresponding variables to be
 global
Doc: declares the corresponding variables to be global. From now on, you are
 forbidden to use them as formal parameters for function definitions or as
 loop indexes. This is especially useful when patching together various
 scripts, possibly written with different naming conventions. For instance the
 following situation is dangerous:
 %
 \bprog
 p = 3   \\@com fix characteristic
 ...
 forprime(p = 2, N, ...)
 f(p) = ...
 @eprog\noindent
 since within the loop or within the function's body (even worse: in the
 subroutines called in that scope), the true global value of \kbd{p} will be
 hidden. If the statement \kbd{global(p = 3)} appears at the beginning of
 the script, then both expressions will trigger syntax errors.
 
 Calling \kbd{global} without arguments prints the list of global variables in
 use. In particular, \kbd{eval(global)} will output the values of all global
 variables.
