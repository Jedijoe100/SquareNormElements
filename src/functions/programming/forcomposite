C-Name: forcomposite
Prototype: vV=GDGI
Help: forcomposite(n=a,{b},seq): the sequence is evaluated, n running over the
 composite numbers between a and b. Omitting b runs through composites >= a
Doc: evaluates \var{seq},
 where the formal variable $n$ ranges over the composite numbers between the
 non-negative real numbers $a$ to $b$, including $a$ and $b$ if they are
 composite. Nothing is done if $a>b$.
 \bprog
 ? forcomposite(n = 0, 10, print(n))

 @eprog\noindent Omitting $b$ means we will run through all composites $\geq a$,
 starting an infinite loop; it is expected that the user will break out of
 the loop himself at some point, using \kbd{break} or \kbd{return}.

 Note that the value of $n$ cannot be modified within \var{seq}:
 \bprog
 ? forcomposite(n = 2, 10, n = [])

  ***   index read-only: was changed to [].
