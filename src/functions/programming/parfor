C-Name: parfor
Prototype: vV=GDGJDVDI
Help: parfor(i=a,{b},expr1,{j,expr2}): the sequence expr2 (dependent on i and j) is
 evaluated for i between a and b, in random order, with j being substitued for
 the value of expr1 (dependent on i), computed in parallel. If b is omitted, the
 loop will not stop.
Doc: the sequence \kbd{expr2} (dependent on $i$ and $j$) is evaluated for $i$
 between $a$ and $b$, in random order, with $j$ being substitued for the value of
 \kbd{expr1} (dependent on $i$), computed in parallel. If $b$ is omitted, the
 loop will not stop.

 It is allowed fo \kbd{expr2} to exit the loop using
 \kbd{break}/\kbd{next}/\kbd{return}, however in that case, \kbd{expr2} will
 still be evaluated for all remaining value of $i$ less than the current one,
 unless a subsequent \kbd{break}/\kbd{next}/\kbd{return} happens.
