Function: kill
Section: programming/specific
C-Name: kill0
Prototype: vr
Help: kill(sym): restores the symbol sym to its ``undefined'' status and kill
 associated help messages.
Doc: restores the symbol \kbd{sym} to its ``undefined'' status, and deletes any
 help messages associated to \kbd{sym} using \kbd{addhelp}. This allows one to
 remove aliases and installed functions, and reset variables to their starting
 values (which can be performed in a simpler way by using the \idx{quote}
 operator \kbd{a = 'a}).
