Function: kill
Section: programming/specific
C-Name: kill0
Prototype: vS
Help: kill(s): kills the present value of the variable or function s.
 Returns new value or 0
Doc: kills the present value of the variable, alias or user-defined
 function $s$. The corresponding identifier
 can now be used to name any GP object (variable or function). This is the
 only way to replace a variable by a function having the same name (or the
 other way round), as in the following example:

 \bprog
 ? f = 1
 %1 = 1
 ? f(x) = 0
 ***   unused characters: f(x)=0
 ^----
 ? kill(f)
 ? f(x) = 0
 ? f()
 %2 = 0
 @eprog

 When you kill a variable, all objects that used it become invalid. You
 can still display them, even though the killed variable will be printed in a
 funny way. For example:

 \bprog
 ? a^2 + 1
 %1 = a^2 + 1
 ? kill(a)
 ? %1
 %2 = #<1>^2 + 1
 @eprog

 If you simply want to restore a variable to its ``undefined'' value
 (monomial of degree one), use the \idx{quote} operator: \kbd{a = 'a}.
 Predefined symbols (\kbd{x} and GP function names) cannot be killed.
