Function: kill
Section: programming/specific
C-Name: kill0
Prototype: vS
Help: kill(s): restores a variable to its ``undefined'' value and kill
 associated help messages. Mostly obsolete.
Doc: restores a variable to its ``undefined'' value (monomial of degree one),
 and deletes any help messages associated to $s$ using \kbd{addhelp}.
 For the first use, you should simply use the \idx{quote} operator:
 \kbd{a = 'a}. More generally, deletes aliases and installed functions.
