Function: forvec
Section: programming
C-Name: forvec
Prototype: vV=GID0,L,
Help: forvec(x=v,seq,{flag=0}): v being a vector of two-component vectors of
 length n, the sequence is evaluated with x[i] going from v[i][1] to v[i][2]
 for i=n,..,1 if flag is zero or omitted. If flag = 1 (resp. flag = 2),
 restrict to increasing (resp. strictly increasing) sequences

Class: gp2c_internal
Help: Initializes parameters for forvec_start.
Description:
 (gen, small, &gen, &func_GG):vec:copy         forvec_start($1, $2, &$3, &$4)
