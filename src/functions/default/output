Doc: there are four possible values: 0
 (=~\var{raw}), 1 (=~\var{prettymatrix}), or 3
 (=~\var{external prettyprint}). This
 means that, independently of the default \kbd{format} for reals which we
 explained above, you can print results in four ways: either in \tev{raw
 format}, i.e.~a format which is equivalent to what you input, including
 explicit multiplication signs, and everything typed on a line instead of
 two dimensional boxes. This can have several advantages, for instance it
 allows you to pick the result with a mouse or an editor, and to paste it
 somewhere else.\label{se:output}

 The second format is the \tev{prettymatrix format}. The only difference to
 raw format is that matrices are printed as boxes instead of horizontally.
 This is prettier, but takes more space and cannot be used for input. Column
 vectors are still printed horizontally.

 The third format is \tev{external prettyprint}, which pipes
 all \kbd{gp} output in TeX format to an external prettyprinter, according to the
 value of \tet{prettyprinter}. The default script (\tet{tex2mail}) converts
 its input to readable two-dimensional text.

 Independently of the setting of this default, an object can be printed
 in any of the two formats at any time using the commands \b{a} and \b{m}
 respectively (see below).

 The default value is \kbd{1} (\var{prettymatrix}).
