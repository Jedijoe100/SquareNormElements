Doc: \kbd{gp}, and in fact any program using the PARI library, needs a
 \tev{stack} in which to do its computations.  If non-zero,  \kbd{parisizemax}
 is the maximum size the stack can grow to, in bytes.  If zero, the stack will
 not automaticall grow, and will be limited to the value of \kbd{parisize}.

 The default value is $0$.
