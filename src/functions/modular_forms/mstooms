Help: mstooms(Mp, phi): given Mp from mspadicinit, lift the
 (classical) eigen symbol phi to a distribution-valued overconvergent symbol
 in the sense of Pollack and Stevens
Doc: given \kbd{Mp} from \kbd{mspadicinit}, lift the (classical) eigen symbol
 \kbd{phi} to a $p$-adic distribution-valued overconvergent symbol in the
 sense of Pollack and Stevens. More precisely, let $\phi$ belong to the space
 $W$ of modular symbols of level $N$, $v_p(N) \leq 1$, and weight $k$ which is
 an eigenvector for the Hecke operator $T_N(p)$ for a non-zero eigenvalue
 $a_p$ and let $N_0 = \text{lcm}(N,p)$.

 Under the action of $T_{N_0}(p)$, $\phi$ generates a subspace $W_\phi$ of
 dimension $1$ (if $p\mid N$) or $2$ (if $p$ does not divide $N$) in the
 space of modular symbols of level $N_0$.

 Let $V_p=[p,0;0,1]$ and $C_p=[a_p,p^{k-1};-1,0]$.
 When $p \not\mid N$ and $a_p$ is divisible by $p$, \kbd{mstooms}
 returns the lift $\Phi$ of $(\phi,\phi|_k V_p)$ such that
  $$T_{N_0}(p) \Phi = C_p \Phi$$

 When $p \not\mid N$ and $a_p$ is not divisible by $p$, \kbd{mstooms}
 returns the lift $\Phi$ of $\phi - \alpha^{-1} \phi|_k V_p$
 which is an eigenvector of $T_{N_0}(p)$ for the unit eigenvalue
 where $\alpha^2 - a_p \alpha + p^{k-1}=0$.
