 $M$ being a full modular symbol space, as given by \kbd{msinit},
 and $H$ being a Hecke-stable subspace, split $H$ into Hecke-simple subspaces.
 A subspace is given by a structure allowing quick projection and restriction
 of linear operators; its first component is a matrix with integer
 coefficients whose columns form a $\Q$-basis of the subspace.

 ? M = msinit(11,8, 1); \\ M_8(Gamma_0(11))^+
 ? L = mssplit(M, msnew(M));
