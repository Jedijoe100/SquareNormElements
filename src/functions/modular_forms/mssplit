Help: mssplit(M,H): M being a full modular symbol space, as given by msinit,
 and H being a subspace, split H into Hecke-simple subspaces.

 $M$ being a full modular symbol space, as given by \kbd{msinit},
 and $H$ being a subspace, split $H$ into Hecke-simple subspaces. The
 simple subspaces are given by projectors suitable for \kbd{msqexpansion}.

 ? M = msinit(11,8, 1); \\ M_8(Gamma_0(11))^+
 ? L = mssplit(M, msnew(M));
