Help: ellmsinit(E, {sign=1}): return the modular symbol associated
 to the elliptic curve E/Q.
Doc: Let $E/\Q$ be an elliptic curve of conductor $N$. Return the (cuspidal,
 new) modular symbol $x^+$ in $H^1_c(X_0(N),\Q)^+$ (resp.~$x^-$ in
 $H^1_c(X_0(N),\Q)^-$ if $\var{sign} = -1$) associated to
 $E$. For all primes $p$ not dividing $N$ we have
 $T_p(x^{\pm}) =  a_p x^{\pm}$, where $a_p = p+1-\#E(\F_p)$.
 This defines a unique symbol up to
 multiplication by a constant and we normalize it so that the associated
 $p$-adic measure yields the $p$-adic $L$-function. Namely, for an odd
 fundamental discriminant $d$ such that $\var{sign}\cdot d > 0$ and
 $L(E^{(d)},1) \neq 0$, let $D = |d|$; we then have $$\sum_{0<a<D} (d|a)
 x^{\pm}([a/D]-[0]) = L(E^{(d),1)}) / \Omega_d,$$ where $\Omega_d$ is the real
 period of the twist $E^{(d)}$.
