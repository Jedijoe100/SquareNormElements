 $M$ being a full modular symbol space, as given by \kbd{msinit},
 return $[E,S]$ its decomposition into Eisenstein and cuspidal parts.
 A subspace is given by a structure allowing quick projection and
 restriction of linear operators; its first component is
 a matrix with integer coefficients whose columns form a $\Q$-basis of
 the subspace.
