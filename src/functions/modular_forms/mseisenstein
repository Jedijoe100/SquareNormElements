Doc:
 $M$ being a full modular symbol space, as given by \kbd{msinit},
 return its Eisenstein subspace. The subspace is given by a matrix (with
 integer coefficients) whose columns form a $\Q$-basis of the space.
 This is the same basis as given the first component of \kbd{mscuspidal}$(M)$.
 \bprog
 ? M = msinit(2,8, 1); \\ M_8(Gamma_0(2))^+
 ? E = mseisenstein(M);
 ? E  \\ 2-dimensional
