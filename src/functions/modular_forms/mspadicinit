Function: mspadicinit
Section: modular_forms
C-Name: mspadicinit
Prototype: GLLD0,L,
Help: mspadicinit(M, p, n, {flag = 0}): M being a full modular symbol space,
 as given by msinit and a prime p, initialize
 technical data needed to compute with overconvergent modular symbols
 (modulo p^n). If flag is 1, initialize only for ordinary symbols,
 such that Tp(s) = ap * s, with (ap,p) = 1.
Doc: $M$ being a full modular symbol space, as given by \kbd{msinit}, and $p$ a prime,
 initialize technical data needed to compute with overconvergent modular symbols,
 modulo $p^n$. If $\fl = 1$, initialize only for ordinary symbols,
 such that $T_p(s) = a_p s$, with $(a_p,p) = 1$, which is faster.
 When $\fl = 0$, we also allow supersingular eigensymbols such that
 $p\mid a_p$, provided $p$ does not divide the level.
