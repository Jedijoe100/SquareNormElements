Function: mspadicmoments
Section: modular_forms
C-Name: mspadicmoments
Prototype: GGD1,L,
Help: mspadicmoments(Mp, PHI, {D = 1}): given Mp from mspadicinit and
 an overconvergent eigensymbol PHI, return the moments of the p-1 distributions
 PHI([0]-[oo]) | (a + pZp), 0 < a < p.
Doc: given \kbd{Mp} from \kbd{mspadicinit} and an overconvergent
 eigensymbol \kbd{PHI}.


 We also allow \kbd{PHI} to be given as a classical symbol, which is then
 lifted to an overconvergent symbol by \kbd{mstooms}.
