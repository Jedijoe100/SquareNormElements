Help: plotterm(\"termname\"): set terminal to plot in high resolution to.
 Ignored by some drivers. In gnuplot driver possible terminals are the same
 as in gnuplot, terminal options can be put after the terminal name and
 space; terminal size can be put immediately after the name, as in
 \"gif=300,200\". If term is \"?\", lists possible values. Positive return
 value means success
