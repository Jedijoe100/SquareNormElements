Prototype: vLL
Help: plotcolor(w,c): in rectwindow w, set default color to c. Possible
 values for c are 1=black, 2=blue, 3=sienna, 4=red, 5=cornsilk, 6=grey,
 7=gainsborough
Doc: 
 set default color to $c$ in rectwindow $w$.
 In present version \vers, this is only implemented for the X11 window system,
 and you only have the following palette to choose from:
 
 1=black, 2=blue, 3=sienna, 4=red, 5=green, 6=grey, 7=gainsborough.
 
 Note that it should be fairly easy for you to hardwire some more colors by
 tweaking the files \kbd{rect.h} and \kbd{plotX.c}. User-defined
 colormaps would be nice, and \emph{may} be available in future versions.
