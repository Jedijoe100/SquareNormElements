Function: plotcolor
Class: highlevel
Section: graphic
C-Name: rectcolor
Prototype: vLL
Help: plotcolor(w,c): in rectwindow w, set default color to c. Possible
 values for c are 1=black, 2=blue, 3=sienna, 4=red, 5=green, 6=grey,
 7=gainsborough
Doc: set default color to $c$ in rectwindow $w$.
 This is only implemented for the X-windows, fltk and Qt graphing engines,
 and you only have the following palette to choose from:
 
 1=black, 2=blue, 3=sienna, 4=red, 5=green, 6=grey, 7=gainsborough.
 
 Note that it is fairly easy to hardwire some more colors by
 tweaking the files \kbd{rect.h} and \kbd{plotxxx.c}. A more flexible scheme
 and runtime-defined colormaps would be nice, and \emph{may} be available in
 future versions.
