Help: bezout(x,y): gives a 3-dimensional row vector [u,v,d] such that
 d=gcd(x,y) and u*x+v*y=d.
Doc: finds $u$ and $v$ minimal in a natural sense such that
 $x*u+y*v=\gcd(x,y)$. The arguments must be both integers or both
 polynomials, and the result is a row vector with three components $u$, $v$,
 and $\gcd(x,y)$. \sidx{extended gcd}
