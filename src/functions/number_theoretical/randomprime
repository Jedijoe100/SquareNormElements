C-Name: randomprime
Prototype: DG
Help: randomprime({N = 2^31}): returns a prime between 2 and N.
Doc: returns a strong pseudo prime (see \tet{ispseudoprime}) between $2$ and
 $N$. A \typ{VEC} $N = [a,b]$ is also allowed, with $a < b$ in which case a
 pseudo prime $a \leq p \leq b$ is returned; if no prime exists in the
 interval, the function will run into an infinite loop. If the upper bound
 is less than $2^{64}$ the pseudo prime returned is a proven prime.
