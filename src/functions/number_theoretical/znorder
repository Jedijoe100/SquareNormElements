Function: znorder
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: znorder
Prototype: GDG
Help: znorder(x,{o}): order of the integermod x in (Z/nZ)*. Optional o is
 assumed to be a multiple of the order.
Description: 
 (gen):int             order($1)
 (gen,):int            order($1)
 (gen,int):int         znorder($1, $2)
Doc: $x$ must be an integer mod $n$, and the
 result is the order of $x$ in the multiplicative group $(\Z/n\Z)^*$. Returns
 an error if $x$ is not invertible. If optional parameter $o$ is given it is
 assumed to be a multiple of the order, used to limit the search space; for
 instance \kbd{o = eulerphi(n)}. This $o$ may be given as a factorization
 matrix, which is especially useful if many orders are to be computed for the
 same $n$: use \kbd{o = factor(eulerphi(n))}, thus factoring $\phi(n)$
 only once.
Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{order}{GEN x}.
