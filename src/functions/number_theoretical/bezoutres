Function: bezoutres
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: vecbezoutres
Prototype: GG
Help: bezoutres(x,y): gives a 3-dimensional row vector [u,v,d] such that
 d=resultant(x,y) and u*x+v*y=d, where x and y are polynomials
Doc: as \kbd{bezout}, with the resultant of $x$ and $y$ replacing the gcd.
 \sidx{extended gcd} The algorithm used (subresultant) assumes that the base
 ring is a domain.
