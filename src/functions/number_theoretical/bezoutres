Function: bezoutres
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: vecbezoutres
Prototype: GG
Help: bezoutres(x,y): gives a 3-dimensional row vector [u,v,d] such that
 d=resultant(x,y) and u*x+v*y=d, where x and y are polynomials
Doc: as \kbd{bezout}, with the resultant of $x$ and
 $y$ replacing the gcd. \sidx{extended gcd} The algorithm uses
 (subresultant) assumes the base ring is a domain.
 
 \syn{vecbezoutres}{x,y} to get the vector, or \funs{subresext}{x,y, \&u, \&v}
 which gives as result the address of the created gcd, and puts the
 addresses of the corresponding created objects into $u$ and $v$.
