Help: quadray(D,f,{flag=0}): relative equation for the ray class field of
 conductor f for the quadratic field of discriminant D (which can also be a
 bnf). For D < 0, flag has the following meaning: if flag is an odd integer,
 output instead the vector of [ideal,corresponding root]. It can also be a
 two component vector [lambda,flag], where flag is as above and lambda is the
 technical element of bnf necessary for Schertz's method. In that case,
 return 0 if lambda is not suitable. For D > 0, if flag is non-zero, try hard
 to find the best modulus
