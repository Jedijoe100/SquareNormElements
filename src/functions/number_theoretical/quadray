C-Name: quadray
Prototype: GGDGp
Help: quadray(D,f,{lambda}): relative equation for the ray class field of
 conductor f for the quadratic field of discriminant D (which can also be a
 bnf). For D < 0, lambda (if supplied) is the technical element of bnf 
 necessary for Schertz's method. In that case, return 0 if lambda is not
 suitable.
Doc: relative equation for the ray
 class field of conductor $f$ for the quadratic field of discriminant $D$
 using analytic methods. A \kbd{bnf} for $x^2 - D$ is also accepted in place
 of $D$.
 
 For $D < 0$, uses the $\sigma$ function. If supplied, \var{lambda} is is the
 technical element $\lambda$ of \kbd{bnf} necessary for Schertz's method. In
 that case, returns 0 if $\lambda$ is not suitable.
 
 For $D>0$, uses Stark's conjecture, and a vector of relative equations may be
 returned. See \tet{bnrstark} for more details.
