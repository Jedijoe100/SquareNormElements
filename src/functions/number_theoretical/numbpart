Prototype: G
Help: numbpart(n): number of partitions of n
Doc: gives the number of unrestricted partitions of
 $n$, usually called $p(n)$ in the literature; in other words the number of
 nonnegative integer solutions to $a+2b+3c+\cdots=n$. $n$ must be of type
 integer and $1\le n<10^{15}$. The algorithm uses the
 Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher formula.
