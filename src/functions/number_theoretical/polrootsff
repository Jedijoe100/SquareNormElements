Function: polrootsff
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: polrootsff
Prototype: GDGDG
Help: polrootsff(x,{p},{a}): returns the roots of the polynomial x in the finite
 field F_p[X]/a(X)F_p[X]. a or p can be omitted if x has t_FFELT coefficients.
Doc: returns the vector of distinct roots of the polynomial $x$ in the field
 $\F_q$ defined by the irreducible polynomial $a$ over $\F_p$. The
 coefficients of $x$ must be operation-compatible with $\Z/p\Z$.
 Either $a$ or $p$ can omitted (in which case both are ignored) if x has
 t_FFELT coefficients.
