Function: core
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: core0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: core(n,{flag=0}): unique (positive of negative) squarefree integer d
 dividing n such that n/d is a square. If (optional) flag is non-null, output
 the two-component row vector [d,f], where d is the unique squarefree integer
 dividing n such that n/d=f^2 is a square
Doc: if $n$ is a non-zero integer written as
 $n=df^2$ with $d$ squarefree, returns $d$. If $\fl$ is non-zero,
 returns the two-element row vector $[d,f]$.
 
 \syn{core0}{n,\fl}.
 Also available are \funs{core}{n} (= \funs{core0}{n,0}) and \funs{core2}{n}
 (= \funs{core0}{n,1}).
