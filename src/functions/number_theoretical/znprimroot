Help: znprimroot(n): returns a primitive root of n when it exists
Description:
 (int):gen	gener($1)
 (gen):gen	ggener($1)
Doc: returns a primitive root (generator) of $(\Z/n\Z)^*$, whenever this
  latter group is cyclic ($n = 4$ or $n = 2p^k$ or $n = p^k$, where $p$ is an
  odd prime and $k \geq 0$). If the group is not cyclic, the result is
  undefined. If $n$ is a prime, then the smallest positive primitive root is
  returned. This is no longer true for composites.

  Note that this function requires factoring $n$ and $p-1$ for each prime
  divisor $p$ of $n$, in order to determine the exact order of elements in
  $(\Z/n\Z)^*$: this is likely to be very costly if $n$ is large.
