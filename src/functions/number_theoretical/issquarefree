Function: issquarefree
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: gissquarefree
Prototype: G
Help: issquarefree(x): true(1) if x is squarefree, false(0) if not
Description: 
 (int):bool	issquarefree($1)
 (gen):gen	gissquarefree($1)
Doc: true (1) if $x$ is squarefree, false (0) if not.
 Here $x$ can be an integer or a polynomial.
 
 \syn{gissquarefree}{x}, but the simpler function \funs{issquarefree}{x}
 which returns a \kbd{long} should be used if $x$ is known to be of type
 integer. This \teb{issquarefree} is just the square of the \idx{Moebius}
 function, and is computed as a multiplicative arithmetic function much like
 the latter.
