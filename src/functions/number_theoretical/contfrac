Function: contfrac
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: contfrac0
Prototype: GDGD0,L,
Help: contfrac(x,{b},{nmax}): continued fraction expansion of x (x
 rational,real or rational function). b and nmax are both optional, where b
 is the vector of numerators of the continued fraction, and nmax is a bound
 for the number of terms in the continued fraction expansion
Doc: creates the row vector whose
 components are the partial quotients of the \idx{continued fraction}
 expansion of $x$. That is a result $[a_0,\dots,a_n]$ means that $x \approx
 a_0+1/(a_1+\dots+1/a_n\dots)$. The output is normalized so that $a_n \neq 1$
 (unless we also have $n = 0$).
 
 The number of partial quotients $n$ is limited to $nmax$. If $x$ is a real
 number, the expansion stops at the last significant partial quotient if
 $nmax$ is omitted. $x$ can also be a rational function or a power series.
 
 If a vector $b$ is supplied, the numerators will be equal to the coefficients
 of $b$ (instead of all equal to $1$ as above). The length of the result is
 then equal to the length of $b$, unless a partial remainder is encountered
 which is equal to zero, in which case the expansion stops. In the case of
 real numbers, the stopping criterion is thus different from the one mentioned
 above since, if $b$ is too long, some partial quotients may not be
 significant.
 
 If $b$ is an integer, the command is understood as \kbd{contfrac($x,nmax$)}.
 
 \syn{contfrac0}{x,b,nmax}. Also available are
 \funs{gboundcf}{x,nmax}, \funs{gcf}{x}, or \funs{gcf2}{b,x}, where $nmax$
 is a C integer.
