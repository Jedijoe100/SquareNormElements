Function: contfrac
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: contfrac0
Prototype: GDGD0,L,
Help: contfrac(x,{b},{nmax}): continued fraction expansion of x (x
 rational,real or rational function). b and nmax are both optional, where b
 is the vector of numerators of the continued fraction, and nmax is a bound
 for the number of terms in the continued fraction expansion
Doc: returns the row vector whose components are the partial quotients of the
 \idx{continued fraction} expansion of $x$. In other words, a result
 $[a_0,\dots,a_n]$ means that $x \approx a_0+1/(a_1+\dots+1/a_n)$. The
 output is normalized so that $a_n \neq 1$ (unless we also have $n = 0$).
 
 The number of partial quotients $n$ is limited to $nmax$. If $x$ is a real
 number, the expansion stops at the last significant partial quotient if
 $nmax$ is omitted. $x$ can also be a rational function or a power series.
 
 If a vector $b$ is supplied, the numerators are equal to the coefficients
 of $b$, instead of all equal to $1$ as above; more precisely, $x \approx
 (1/b_0)(a_0+b_1/(a_1+\dots+b_n/a_n))$; for a numerical continued fraction
 ($x$ real), the $a_i$ are integers, as large as possible; if $x$ is a
 rational function, they are polynomials with $\deg a_i = \deg b_i + 1$.

 The length of the result is then equal to the length of $b$, unless the next
 partial quotient cannot be reliably computed, in which case the expansion
 stops. This happens when a partial remainder is equal to zero (or too small
 compared to the available significant digits for $x$ a \typ{REAL}).

 \misctitle{Obsolete hack} (don't use this): If $b$ is an integer, \var{nmax}
 is ignored and the command is understood as \kbd{contfrac($x,, b$)}.
Variant: Also available are \fun{GEN}{gboundcf}{GEN x, long nmax} and
 \fun{GEN}{gcf}{GEN x}.
