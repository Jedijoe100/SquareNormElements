Function: ispower
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: ispower
Prototype: lGDGD&
Help: ispower(x,{k},{&n}): true (1) if x is a k-th power, false (0) if not.
 If n is given and a k-th root was computed in the process, put that in n.
 If k is omitted, return the maximal k >= 2 such that x = n^k is a
 perfect power, or 0 if no such k exist.
Description: 
 (int):small       isanypower($1, NULL)
 (int, &int):small isanypower($1, &$2)
Doc: if $k$ is given, returns true (1) if $x$ is a $k$-th power, false
 (0) if not.
 
 If $k$ is omitted, only integers and fractions are allowed for $x$ and the
 function returns the maximal $k \geq 2$ such that $x = n^k$ is a perfect
 power, or 0 if no such $k$ exist; in particular \kbd{ispower(-1)},
 \kbd{ispower(0)}, and \kbd{ispower(1)} all return $0$.
 
 If a third argument $\&n$ is given and $x$ is indeed a $k$-th power, sets
 $n$ to a $k$-th root of $x$.
 
 \syn{ispower}{x, k, \&n}, the result is a \kbd{long}. Omitted $k$ or $n$
 are coded as \kbd{NULL}.
