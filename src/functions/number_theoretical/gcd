Doc: creates the greatest common divisor of $x$
 and $y$. $x$ and $y$ can be of quite general types, for instance both
 rational numbers. If $y$ is omitted and $x$ is a vector, returns the
 $\text{gcd}$ of all components of $x$, i.e.~this is equivalent to
 \kbd{content(x)}.
 
 
 When $x$ and $y$ are both given and one of them is a vector/matrix type,
 the GCD is again taken recursively on each component, but in a different way.
 If $y$ is a vector, resp.~matrix, then the result has the same type as $y$,
 and components equal to \kbd{gcd(x, y[i])}, resp.~\kbd{gcd(x, y[,i])}. Else
 if $x$ is a vector/matrix the result has the same type as $x$ and an
 analogous definition. Note that for these types, \kbd{gcd} is not
 commutative.
 
 The algorithm used is a naive \idx{Euclid} except for the following inputs:
 
 \item integers: use modified right-shift binary (``plus-minus''
 variant).
 
 \item univariate polynomials with coeffients in the same number
 field (in particular rational): use modular gcd algorithm.
 
 \item general polynomials: use the \idx{subresultant algorithm} if
 coefficient explosion is likely (exact, non modular, coefficients).
 
 \syn{ggcd}{x,y}. For general polynomial inputs, \funs{srgcd}{x,y} is also
 available. For univariate \emph{rational} polynomials, one also has
 \funs{modulargcd}{x,y}.
