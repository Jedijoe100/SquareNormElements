Help: znconreyconductor(bid,chi, {&chi0}): Let bid be idealstar(,q) and chi
 be a Dirichlet character on (Z/qZ)* given by its Conrey logarithm. Return
 the conductor of chi, and set chi0 to (the Conrey logarithm of) the
 associated primitive character
Doc: Let \var{bid} be associated to $(\Z/q\Z)^*$ (as per \kbd{bid =
 idealstar(,q)}) and \kbd{chi} be a Dirichlet character on $(\Z/q\Z)^*$,
 given by

 \item a \typ{VEC}: a standard character on \kbd{bid.gen},

 \item a \typ{INT} or a \typ{COL}: a Conrey index in $(\Z/q\Z)^*$ or its
 Conrey logarithm (see \tet{znconreychar} and \tet{znconreylog}).

 Return the conductor of \kbd{chi}, as the \typ{INT} \kbd{bid.mod}
 if \kbd{chi} is primitive, and as a pair \kbd{[N, faN]} (with \kbd{faN} the
 factorization of $N$) otherwise.

 If \kbd{chi0} is present, set it to the Conrey logarithm of the associated
 primitive character.
