Help: bestappr(A,{B}): gives the best approximation to the real A with
 denominator less or equal to B
Doc: if $B$ is omitted, finds the best rational
 approximation to $x\in\R$ (or $\R[X]$, or $\R^n$, \dots) with denominator at
 most equal to $A$ using continued fractions.
 
 If $B$ is present, $x$ is assumed to be of type \typ{INTMOD} modulo $M$ (or a
 recursive combination of those), and the routine returns the unique fraction
 $a/b$ in coprime integers $a\leq A$ and $b\leq B$ which is congruent to $x$
 modulo $M$. If $M \leq 2AB$, uniqueness is not guaranteed and the function
 fails with an error message. If rational reconstruction is not possible
 (no such $a/b$ exists for at least one component of $x$), returns $-1$.

 to an omitted $B$.
