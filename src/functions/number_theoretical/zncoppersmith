Help: zncoppersmith(P, N, X, {B=N}): finds all integers x0
 with |x0| <= X such that  gcd(N, P(x0)) > B. X should be smaller than
 exp((log B)^2 / (deg(P) log N)).
Doc: finds all integers $x_0$ with $|x_0| \leq X$ such that
 $$\gcd(N, P(x_0)) \geq B.$$
 If $N$ is prime or a prime power, \tet{polrootsmod} or \tet{polrootspadic}
 will be much faster. $X$ must be smaller than $\exp(\log^2 B / (\deg(P) \log
 N))$.
