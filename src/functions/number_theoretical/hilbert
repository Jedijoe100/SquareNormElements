Help: hilbert(x,y,{p}): Hilbert symbol at p of x,y. If x,y are integermods
 or p-adic, p can be omitted
Doc: \idx{Hilbert symbol} of $x$ and $y$ modulo
 $p$. If $x$ and $y$ are of type integer or fraction, an explicit third
 parameter $p$ must be supplied, $p=0$ meaning the place at infinity.
 Otherwise, $p$ needs not be given, and $x$ and $y$ can be of compatible types
 integer, fraction, real, intmod a prime (result is undefined if the
 modulus is not prime), or $p$-adic.
