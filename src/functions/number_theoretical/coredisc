C-Name: coredisc0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: coredisc(n,{flag=0}): discriminant of the quadratic field Q(sqrt(n)).
 If (optional) flag is non-null, output a two-component row vector [d,f],
 where d is the discriminant of the quadratic field Q(sqrt(n)) and n=df^2. f
 may be a half integer
Doc: if $n$ is a non-zero integer written as
 $n=df^2$ with $d$ fundamental discriminant (including 1), returns $d$. If
 $\fl$ is non-zero, returns the two-element row vector $[d,f]$. Note that if
 $n$ is not congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4, $f$ will be a half integer and not
 an integer.
