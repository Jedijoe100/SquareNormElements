Function: addprimes
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: addprimes
Prototype: DG
Help: addprimes({x=[]}): add primes in the vector x (with at most 100
 components) to the prime table. x may also be a single integer. The
 \"primes\" may in fact be composite, obtained for example by the function
 factor(x,0), and in that case the message \"impossible inverse modulo\" will
 give you some factors. List the current extra primes if x is omitted. If
 some primes are added which divide non trivially the existing table,
 suitable updating is done
