Help: quadhilbert(D,{pq}): relative equation for the Hilbert class field
 of the quadratic field of discriminant D (which can also be a bnf).
 If D<0, pq (if supplied) is a 2-component vector [p,q], where p,q are the
 prime numbers needed for Schertz's method. In that case, return 0 if [p,q]
 not suitable.
Doc: relative equation defining the
 \idx{Hilbert class field} of the quadratic field of discriminant $D$.
 
 If $D < 0$, uses complex multiplication (\idx{Schertz}'s variant). The
 technical component $pq$, if supplied, is a vector $[p,q]$ where $p$, $q$ are
 the prime numbers needed for the Schertz's method. More precisely, prime
 ideals above $p$ and $q$ should be non-principal and coprime to all reduced
 representatives of the class group. In addition, if one of these ideals has
 order $2$ in the class group, they should have the same class. Finally, for
 efficiency, $\gcd(24,(p-1)(q-1))$ should be as large as possible.
 The routine returns $0$ if $[p,q]$ is not suitable.
 
 If $D > 0$ \idx{Stark units} are used and (in rare cases) a
 vector of extensions may be returned whose compositum is the requested class
 field. See \kbd{bnrstark} for details.
