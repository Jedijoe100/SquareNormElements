Help: quadhilbert(D,{flag=0}): relative equation for the Hilbert class field
 of the quadratic field of discriminant D (which can also be a bnf). If flag
 is a non-zero integer and D<0, list of [form,root(form)] (used for
 contructing subfields). If D<0, flag can also be a 2-component vector [p,q],
 where p,q are the prime numbers needed for Schertz's method. In that case,
 return 0 if [p,q] not suitable. If D>0 and flag is non-zero, try hard to
 find the best modulus
