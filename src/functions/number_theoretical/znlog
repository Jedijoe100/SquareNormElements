Function: znlog
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: znlog
Prototype: GG
Help: znlog(x,g): g as output by znprimroot (modulo a prime). Return
 smallest non-negative n such that g^n = x
Doc: $g$ must be a primitive root mod a prime $p$, and
 the result is the discrete log of $x$ in the multiplicative group
 $(\Z/p\Z)^*$. This function uses a simple-minded combination of
 Pohlig-Hellman algorithm and Shanks baby-step/giant-step which requires
 $O(\sqrt{q})$ storage, where $q$ is the largest prime factor of $p-1$. Hence
 it cannot be used when the largest prime divisor of $p-1$ is greater than
 about $10^{13}$.
