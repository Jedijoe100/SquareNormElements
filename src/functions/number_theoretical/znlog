Function: znlog
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: znlog
Prototype: GG
Help: znlog(x,g): g as output by znprimroot (modulo a prime). Return
 smallest non-negative n such that g^n = x
Doc: let $N$ such that $(\Z/N\Z)^*$ is cyclic and $g$ a primitive root mod
 $N$, as would be output by \kbd{znprimroot}$(N)$. 
 The result is the discrete log of $x$ in the multiplicative group
 $(\Z/N\Z)^*$. This function uses a simple-minded combination of
 Pohlig-Hellman algorithm and Shanks baby-step/giant-step which requires
 $O(\sqrt{q})$ storage, where $q$ is the largest prime factor of $p-1$ ($p$
 odd prime divisor of $N$). Hence it cannot be used when the
 $q$ is greater than about $10^{13}$.
 \bprog
 ? g = znprimroot(101)
 %1 = Mod(2,101)
 ? znlog(5, g)
 %2 = 24
 ? g^24
 %3 = Mod(5, 101)

 ? G = znprimroot(2 * 101^10)
 %4 = Mod(110462212541120451003, 220924425082240902002)
 ? znlog(5, G)
 %5 = 76210072736547066624
 ? G^% == 5
 %6 = 1
 @eprog\noindent The result is undefined when $g$ is not a primitive root
 or when $x$ is not invertible mod $N$:
 \bprog
 ? znlog(Mod(2,4), Mod(1,3))
 %3 = 1  \\ @com Junk in, junk out
 ? znlog(6, Mod(2,3))
   *** znlog: impossible inverse modulo: Mod(0, 3).
 @eprog\noindent For convenience, $g$ is also allowed to be a $p$-adic number:
 \bprog
 ? g = 3+O(5^10); znlog(2, g)
 %1 = 1015243
 ? g^%
 %2 = 2 + O(5^10)
