Function: znlog
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: znlog
Prototype: GG
Help: znlog(x,g): g as output by znprimroot (modulo a prime). Return
 smallest non-negative n such that g^n = x
Doc: $g$ must be a primitive root mod a prime $p$, and
 the result is the discrete log of $x$ in the multiplicative group
 $(\Z/p\Z)^*$. This function uses a simple-minded combination of
 Pohlig-Hellman algorithm and Shanks baby-step/giant-step which requires
 $O(\sqrt{q})$ storage, where $q$ is the largest prime factor of $p-1$. Hence
 it cannot be used when the largest prime divisor of $p-1$ is greater than
 about $10^{13}$.
 
 \bprog
 ? g = znprimroot(101)
 %1 = Mod(2,101)
 ? znlog(Mod(5,101), g)
 %2 = 24
 ? g^24
 %3 = Mod(5, 101)
 @eprog\noindent
 The result is undefined when $g$ is not a primitive root modulo a prime:
 \bprog
 ? znlog(Mod(2,4), Mod(1,3))
 %3 = 1  \\ @com{Junk in, junk out}
