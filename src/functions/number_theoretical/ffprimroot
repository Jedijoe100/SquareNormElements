Function: ffprimroot
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: ffprimroot
Prototype: GD&
Help: ffprimroot(x, {&o}): return a primitive root of the multiplicative group
 of the definition field of the finite field element x (not necessarily the
 same as the field generated by x). If present, o is set to the factorization
 of the order of the primitive root (useful in fflog).
Doc: return a primitive root of the multiplicative
 group of the definition field of the finite field element $x$ (not necessarily
 the same as the field generated by $x$). If present, $o$ is set to the
 factorization of the order of the primitive root (useful in \tet{fflog}).

 For simple inputs as the above last two, providing the extra argument \kbd{o}
 yields interesting speedups.
