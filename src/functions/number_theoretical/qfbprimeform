Function: qfbprimeform
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: primeform
Prototype: GGp
Help: qfbprimeform(x,p): returns the prime form of discriminant x, whose
 first coefficient is p
Doc: prime binary quadratic form of discriminant
 $x$ whose first coefficient is the prime number $p$. By abuse of notation,
 $p = \pm 1$ is a valid special case which returns the unit form. Returns an
 error if $x$ is not a quadratic residue mod $p$. In the case where $x>0$,
 $p < 0$ is allowed, and the ``distance'' component of the form is set equal
 to zero according to the current precision. (Note that negative definite
 \typ{QFI} are not implemented.)
 
 \syn{primeform}{x,p,\var{prec}}, where the third variable $\var{prec}$ is a
 \kbd{long}, but is only taken into account when $x>0$.
