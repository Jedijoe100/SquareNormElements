Help: imag(x): imaginary part of x
Doc: 
 imaginary part of $x$. When
 $x$ is a quadratic number, this is the coefficient of $\omega$ in
 the ``canonical'' integral basis $(1,\omega)$.
 
 \syn{gimag}{x}. This returns a copy of the imaginary part. The internal
 routine \tet{imag_i} is faster, since it returns the pointer and skips the
 copy.
