 conjugate vector representation of $x$. If $x$ is a
 polmod, equal to \kbd{Mod}$(a,q)$, this gives a vector of length
 $\text{degree}(q)$ containing the complex embeddings of the polmod if $q$ has
 integral or rational coefficients, and the conjugates of the polmod if $q$
 has some intmod coefficients. The order is the same as that of the
 \kbd{polroots} functions. If $x$ is an integer or a rational number, the
 result is~$x$. If $x$ is a (row or column) vector, the result is a matrix
 whose columns are the conjugate vectors of the individual elements of $x$.
