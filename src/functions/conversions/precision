Function: precision
Section: conversions
C-Name: precision0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: precision(x,{n}): change the precision of x to be n. If n is omitted,
 output real precision of object x
Doc: gives the precision in decimal digits of the PARI object $x$. If $x$ is
 an exact object, the largest single precision integer is returned. If $n$ is
 not omitted, creates a new object equal to $x$ with a new precision $n$.
 This is to be understood as follows:
 
 For exact types, no change. For $x$ a vector or a matrix, the operation is
 done componentwise.
 
 For real $x$, $n$ is the number of desired significant \emph{decimal}
 digits. If $n$ is smaller than the precision of $x$, $x$ is truncated,
 otherwise $x$ is extended with zeros.
 
 For $x$ a $p$-adic or a power series, $n$ is the desired number of
 significant $p$-adic or $X$-adic digits, where $X$ is the main variable of
 $x$.
 
 Note that the function \kbd{precision} never changes the type of the result.
 In particular it is not possible to use it to obtain a polynomial from a
 power series. For that, see \kbd{truncate}.
 
Variant: Also available are \fun{GEN}{gprec}{GEN x, long n} and
 \fun{long}{precision}{GEN x}. In both, the accuracy is expressed in
 \emph{words} (32-bit or 64-bit depending on the architecture).
