C-Name: gtovecsmall0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: Vecsmall(x, {n}): transforms the object x into a VECSMALL of dimension n.
Description:
 (gen):vecsmall                gtovecsmall($1)
Doc:
 transforms the object $x$ into a row vector of type \typ{VECSMALL}. The
 dimension of the resulting vector can be optionally specified via the extra
 parameter $n$.

 This acts as \kbd{Vec}$(x,n), but only on a limited set of objects:
 the result must be representable as a vector of small integers. In
 particular, polynomials and power series are forbidden. If $x$ is a character
 string, a vector of individual characters in ASCII encoding is returned
 (\tet{Strchr} yields back the character string).

 If you really want to try and transform a polynomial or power series to a
 \typ{VECSMALL}, use \kbd{Vecsmall(Vec(x, n))}. This will fail if one
 coefficient of $x$ is not a small integer.
