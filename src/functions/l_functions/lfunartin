Help: lfunartin(nf,gal,M,n): returns the Ldata structure associated to the
 Artin L-function associated to the representation R of the Galois group
 of the extension K/Q, defined over the cyclotomic field Q(zeta_n),
 where nf is the nfinit structure associated to K,
 gal is the galoisinit structure associated to K/Q, and M is the vector
 of the image of the generators G.gen by R. The elements of M are matrices
 with polynomial entries, whose variable is understood as the complex
 number exp(2*I*Pi/n).
Doc: returns the Ldata structure associated to the
 Artin $L$-function associated to the representation $\rho$ of the Galois group
 of the extension $K/\Q$, defined over the cyclotomic field $\Q(\zeta_n)$,
 where \kbd{nf} is the nfinit structure associated to $K$,
 \kbd{gal} is the galoisinit structure associated to $K/\Q$, and \kbd{M} is
 the vector of the image of the generators \kbd{G.gen} by $\rho$.
 The elements of \kbd{M} are matrices with polynomial entries, whose variable
 is understood as the complex number $\exp(2\*i\*\pi/n)$.

 In the following example we build the Artin $L$-functions associated to the two
 irreducible degree $2$ representations of the dihedral group $D_{10}$ defined
 over $\Q(\zeta_5)$, for the extension $H/\Q$ where $H$ is the Hilbert class
 field of $\Q(\sqrt{-47})$.
 We show numerically some identities involving Dedekind $\zeta$ functions and
 Hecke $L$ series.

 The first identity is the factorisation of the regular representation of
 $D_{10}$, the second the factorisation of the natural representation of
 $D_{10}\subset S_5$, the next two are the expressions of the degree $2$
 representations as induced from degree $1$ representations.
