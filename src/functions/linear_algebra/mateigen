Function: mateigen
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: eigen
Prototype: Gp
Help: mateigen(x): complex eigenvectors of the matrix x given as columns of a
 matrix.
Doc: returns the (complex) eigenvectors of $x$ as columns of a matrix.
 This function first computes the characteristic polynomial of $x$, then
 approximates its complex roots $(\lambda_i)$, then tries to compute the
 eigenspaces as kernels of the $x - \lambda_i$. This algorithm is
 ill-conditioned and is likely to miss kernel vectors if some roots of the
 characteristic polynomial are close, in particular if it has multiple roots.
 For symmetric matrices, use \tet{qfjacobi} instead; for Hermitian matrices,
 compute
 \bprog
  A = real(x);
  B = imag(x);
  y = matconcat([A, -B; B, A]);
 @eprog\noindent and apply \kbd{qfjacobi} to $y$.
