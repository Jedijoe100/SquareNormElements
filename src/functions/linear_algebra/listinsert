Function: listinsert
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: listinsert
Prototype: GGL
Help: listinsert(list,x,n): insert x at index n in list, shifting the
 remaining elements to the right
Description: 
 (list, gen, small):gen	listinsert($1, $2, $3)
Doc: inserts the object $x$ at
 position $n$ in \var{list} (which must be of type \typ{LIST}). All the
 remaining elements of \var{list} (from position $n+1$ onwards) are shifted
 to the right. This and \kbd{listput} are the only commands which enable
 you to increase a list's effective length (as long as it remains under
 the maximal length specified at the time of the \kbd{listcreate}).
 
 This function is useless in library mode.
