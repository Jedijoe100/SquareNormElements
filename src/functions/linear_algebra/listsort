Function: listsort
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: listsort
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: listsort(list,{flag=0}): sort list in place. If flag is non-zero,
 suppress all but one occurence of each element in list
Doc: sorts \var{list} (which must
 be of type \typ{LIST}) in place. If $\fl$ is non-zero, suppresses all repeated
 coefficients. This is much faster than the \kbd{vecsort} command since no
 copy has to be made.
 
 This function is useless in library mode.
