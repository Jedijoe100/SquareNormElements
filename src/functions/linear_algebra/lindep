C-Name: lindep0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: lindep(x,{flag=0}): Z-linear dependencies between components of x.
 flag is optional, and can be 0: default, PSLQ; -1: using Hastad et al; -2:
 returns a non-trivial kernel vector (not integral in general); positive, and
 in that case should be between 0.5 and 1.0 times the accuracy in decimal
 digits of x, using a standard LLL.
Doc: \sidx{linear dependence}$x$ being a
 vector with $p$-adic or real/complex coefficients, finds a small integral
 linear combination among these coefficients.

 If $x$ is $p$-adic, $\fl$ is meaningless and the algorithm LLL-reduces a
 suitable (dual) lattice.

 Otherwise, the value of $\fl$ determines the algorithm used; in the current
 version of PARI, we suggest to use \emph{non-negative} values, since it is by
 far the fastest and most robust implementation. See the detailed example in
 \secref{se:algdep} (\kbd{algdep}).

 If $\fl\geq 0$, uses a floating point (variable precision) LLL algorithm.
 This is in general much faster than the other variants.
 If $\fl = 0$ the accuracy is chosen internally using a crude heuristic.
 If $\fl > 0$ the computation is done with an accuracy of $\fl$ decimal digits.
 In that case, the parameter $\fl$ should be between 0.6 and 0.9 times the
 number of correct decimal digits in the input.

 If $\fl=-1$, uses a variant of the \idx{LLL} algorithm due to Hastad,
 Lagarias and Schnorr (STACS 1986). If the precision is too low, the routine
 may enter an infinite loop.

 If $\fl=-2$, $x$ is allowed to be (and in any case interpreted as) a matrix.
 Returns a non trivial element of the kernel of $x$, or $0$ if $x$ has trivial
 kernel. The element is defined over the field of coefficients of $x$, and is
 in general not integral.

 If $\fl=-3$, uses the PSLQ algorithm. This may return a real number $B$,
 indicating that the input accuracy was exhausted and that no relation exist
 whose sup norm is less than $B$.

 If $\fl=-4$, uses an experimental 2-level PSLQ, which does not work at all.
 (Should be rewritten.)

Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{lindep}{GEN x, long prec} ($\fl=0$).
