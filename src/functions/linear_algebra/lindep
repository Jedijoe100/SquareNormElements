Function: lindep
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: lindep0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: lindep(x,{flag=0}): Z-linear dependencies between components of x,
 using LLL. flag is optional, and can be 0: default, guess a suitable
 accuracy, or positive: accuracy to use for the computation, in decimal
 digits.
Doc: \sidx{linear dependence}$x$ being a vector with $p$-adic or real/complex
 coefficients, finds a small integral linear combination among these
 coefficients.

 If $x$ is $p$-adic, $\fl$ is meaningless and the algorithm LLL-reduces a
 suitable (dual) lattice.

 Otherwise, we use a floating point (variable precision) LLL algorithm.
 If $\fl = 0$ the accuracy is chosen internally using a crude heuristic.
 If $\fl > 0$ the computation is done with an accuracy of $\fl$ decimal digits.
 To get meaningful results in the latter case, the parameter $\fl$ should be
 smaller than the number of correct decimal digits in the input.

Variant: Also available are \fun{GEN}{lindep}{GEN x} ($\fl=0$)
 \fun{GEN}{lindep2}{GEN x, long bit} ($\fl\geq 0$, bypasses the check for
 $p$-adic inputs).
