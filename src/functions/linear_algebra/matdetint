Function: matdetint
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: detint
Prototype: G
Help: matdetint(x): some multiple of the determinant of the lattice
 generated by the columns of x (0 if not of maximal rank). Useful with
 mathnfmod
Doc: 
 $x$ being an $m\times n$ matrix with integer
 coefficients, this function computes a \emph{multiple} of the determinant of the
 lattice generated by the columns of $x$ if it is of rank $m$, and returns
 zero otherwise. This function can be useful in conjunction with the function
 \kbd{mathnfmod} which needs to know such a multiple. To obtain the
 exact determinant (assuming the rank is maximal), you can compute
 \kbd{matdet(mathnfmod(x, matdetint(x)))}.
 
 Note that as soon as one of the dimensions gets large ($m$ or $n$ is larger
 than 20, say), it will often be much faster to use \kbd{mathnf(x, 1)} or
 \kbd{mathnf(x, 4)} directly.
