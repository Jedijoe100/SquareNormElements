Function: algdep
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: algdep0
Prototype: GLD0,L,p
Help: algdep(x,n,{flag=0}): algebraic relations up to degree n of x. flag is
 optional, and can be 0: default, uses the algorithm of Hastad et al, or
 non-zero, and in that case is a number of decimal digits which should be
 between 0.5 and 1.0 times the number of decimal digits of accuracy of x, and
