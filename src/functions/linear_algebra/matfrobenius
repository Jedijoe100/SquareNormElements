Function: matfrobenius
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: matfrobenius
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: matfrobenius(M,{flag}): Return the Frobenius form of the square matrix
 M. If flag is 1, return only the elementary divisors. If flag is 2, return
 a two component vector [F,B] where F is the Frobenius form and B is the basis
 change so that M=B^-1*F*B.
