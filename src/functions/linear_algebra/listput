Function: listput
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: listput
Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: listput(list,x,{n}): sets n-th element of list equal to x. If n is
 omitted or greater than the current list length, just append x
Description: 
 (list, gen, small):gen	listput($1, $2, $3)
Doc: 
 sets the $n$-th element of the list
 \var{list} (which must be of type \typ{LIST}) equal to $x$. If $n$ is omitted,
 or greater than the list current effective length, just appends $x$. This and
 \kbd{listinsert} are the only commands which enable you to increase a list's
 effective length (as long as it remains under the maximal length specified at
 the time of the \kbd{listcreate}).
 
 If you want to put an element into an occupied cell, i.e.~if you don't want to
 change the effective length, you can consider the list as a vector and use
 the usual \kbd{list[n] = x} construct.
