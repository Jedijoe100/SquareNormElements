Function: qfauto
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: qfauto0
Prototype: GDG
Help: qfauto(G,{fl}): automorphism group of the positive definite quadratic form
 G.
Doc:
 $G$ being a square and symmetric matrix with integer entries representing a
 positive definite quadratic form, outputs the automorphism group of the form.

 $G$ can also be given by an \kbd{qfisominit} structure.

 This implements an algorithm of Plesken and Souvignier, following closely
 Souvignier own implementation.

 The output is a two-components vector $[o,g]$ where $o$ is the group
 order and $g$ is the list of generators (as a vector).

 The interface of this function is experimental and will likely change in future
 release.  See \kbd{qfisominit} for the meaning of \kbd{fl}.

 Since this requires computing the minimal vectors, the computations can
 become very lengthy as the dimension of $G$ grows.
