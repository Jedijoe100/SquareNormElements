Function: qfisom
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: qfisom0
Prototype: GGDG
Help: qfisom(G,H,{fl}): find an isomorphism between the integral positive definite
 quadratic forms G and H if it exists. G can also be given by an isom structure
 which is preferable if several forms need to be compared to G.
Doc:
 $G,H$ being square and symmetric matrices with integer entries representing a
 positive definite quadratic form, find an isomorphism between $G$ and $H$.
 Since this requires computing the minimal vectors, the computations can
 become very lengthy as the dimension grows.
 See \kbd{qfisominit} for the meaning of \kbd{fl}.

 $G$ can also be given by an \kbd{qfisominit} structure which is preferable if
 several forms $H$ need to be compared to $G$.

 This function implements an algorithm of Plesken and Souvignier, following
 Souvignier's implementation.

Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{qfisom}{GEN F, GEN FF, GEN flags}
 which handles matrices with \typ{VECSMALL} columns.
