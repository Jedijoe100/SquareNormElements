Function: qfisom
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: qfisom0
Prototype: GGDG
Help: qfisom(G,H,{fl}): find an isomorphism between the integral positive definite
 quadratic forms G and H if it exists. G can also be given by an isom structure
 which is preferable if several forms need to be compared to G.
Doc:
 $G$ being a square and symmetric matrix with integer entries representing a
 positive definite quadratic form, outputs the automorphism group of the form.

 $G$ can also be given by an \kbd{qfisominit} structure which is preferable if
 several forms $H$ need to be compared to $G$.

 This implements an algorithm of Plesken and Souvignier, following closely
 Souvignier own implementation.

 See \kbd{qfisominit} for the meaning of \kbd{fl}.

 Since this requires computing the minimal vectors, the computations can
 become very lengthy as the dimension of $G$ grows.
Variant: Also available is
 \fun{GEN}{qfisom}{GEN F, GEN FF, GEN flags}
 which handles matrices with \typ{VECSMALL} columns.
