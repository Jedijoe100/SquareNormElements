 faster.
Doc:
 $x$ being a square and symmetric matrix with integer entries representing a
 positive definite quadratic form, return an \kbd{isom} structure allowing to
 compute isomorphisms between $x$ and other quadratic forms faster.

 The interface of this function is experimental and will likely change in future
 release.

 If present, the optional parameter \kbd{fl} must be a \typ{VEC} with two
 components. It allows to specifiy the invariants used, which can make the
 computation faster or slower. The components are

 $\bullet$ \kbd{fl[1]} Depth of scalar product combination to use.

 $\bullet$ \kbd{fl[2]} Maximum level of Bacher polynomials to use.

 Since this function computes the minimal vectors, it can become very lengthy
 as the dimension of $G$ grows.
