Function: matker
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: matker0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: matker(x,{flag=0}): basis of the kernel of the matrix x. flag is
 optional, and may be set to 0: default; non-zero: x is known to have
 integral entries.
Doc: gives a basis for the kernel of the
 matrix $x$ as columns of a matrix. A priori the matrix can have entries of
 any type.

 If $x$ is known to have integral entries, set $\fl=1$.

 \misctitle{Note:} The library function $\tet{FpM_ker}(x, p)$, where $x$ has
 integer entries \emph{reduced mod p} and $p$ is prime, is equivalent to, but
 orders of magnitude faster than, \kbd{matker(x*Mod(1,p))} and needs much
 less stack space. To use it under \kbd{gp}, type \kbd{install(FpM\_ker, GG)} first.

Variant: Also available are \fun{GEN}{ker}{GEN x} ($\fl=0$),
 \fun{GEN}{keri}{GEN x} ($\fl=1$).
