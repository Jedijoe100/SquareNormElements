Help: listcreate(): creates an empty list.
Description:
 (?int):void        listcreate()
 (small):list       listcreate()
Doc: creates an empty list. This routine used to have a mandatory argument,
 which is now ignored (for backward compatibility). In fact, this function
 has become redundant and obsolete; it will disappear in future versions of
 PARI: just use \kbd{List()}
 % \syn{NO}
