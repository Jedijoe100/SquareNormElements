 \idx{decomposition into squares} of the
 quadratic form represented by the symmetric matrix $q$. The result is a
 matrix whose diagonal entries are the coefficients of the squares, and the
 non-diagonal entries represent the bilinear forms. More precisely, if
 $(a_{ij})$ denotes the output, one has
 $$ q(x) = \sum_i a_{ii} (x_i + \sum_{j>i} a_{ij} x_j)^2 $$
