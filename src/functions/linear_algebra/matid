Function: matid
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: matid
Prototype: L
Help: matid(n): identity matrix of order n (n C-integer)
Description: 
 (small):vec    matid($1)
Doc: creates the $n\times n$ identity matrix.
 
 \syn{matid}{n} where $n$ is a \kbd{long}.
 
 Related functions are \funs{gscalmat}{x,n}, which creates $x$ times the
 identity matrix ($x$ being a \kbd{GEN} and $n$ a \kbd{long}), and
 \funs{gscalsmat}{x,n} which is the same when $x$ is a \kbd{long}.
