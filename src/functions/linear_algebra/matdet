Function: matdet
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: det0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: matdet(x,{flag=0}): determinant of the matrix x using Gauss-Bareiss.
 If (optional) flag is set to 1, use classical Gaussian elimination (not very
 good for integer entries).
Description:
 (gen, ?0):gen           det($1)
 (gen, 1):gen            det2($1)
 (gen, #small):gen       $"incorrect flag in matdet"
 (gen, small):gen        det0($1, $2)
Doc: determinant of $x$. $x$ must be a square matrix.

 If $\fl=0$, uses Gauss-Bareiss or a method due to Dixon, Pernet and Stein if
 $x$ has integer entries.

 If $\fl=1$, uses classical Gaussian elimination, which is better when the
 entries of the matrix are reals or integers for example, but usually much
 worse for more complicated entries like multivariate polynomials.

Variant: Also available are \fun{GEN}{det}{GEN x} ($\fl=0$),
 \fun{GEN}{det2}{GEN x} ($\fl=1$) and \fun{GEN}{ZM_det}{GEN x} for integer
 entries.
