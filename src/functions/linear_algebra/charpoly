C-Name: charpoly0
Prototype: GDnD0,L,
Help: charpoly(A,{v=x},{flag=0}): det(v*Id-A)=characteristic polynomial of
 the matrix or polmod A. flag is optional and may be set to 1 (use
 Lagrange interpolation) or 2 (use Hessenberg form), 0 being the default

 \idx{characteristic polynomial}
 of $A$ with respect to the variable $v$, i.e.~determinant of $v*I-A$ if $A$
 is a square matrix. If $A$ is not a square matrix, it returns the
 characteristic polynomial of the map ``multiplication by $A$'' if $A$ is a
 scalar, in particular a polmod. E.g.~\kbd{charpoly(I) = x\pow2+1}.
 
 The value of $\fl$ is only significant for matrices. Let $n$ be the dimension
 of $A$.
 
 If $\fl=0$, the method used is essentially the same as for computing the
 adjoint matrix, i.e.~computing the traces of the powers of $A$. Assumes that
 $n!$ is invertible.
 
 If $\fl=1$, uses Lagrange interpolation which is usually the slowest method.
 Assumes that $n!$ is invertible.
 
 If $\fl=2$, uses the Hessenberg form. Assumes that the base ring is a field.
 This last variant is the fastest whenever coefficient explosion does not
 occur, e.g.~over a finite field or the reals. It is usually slower in other
 base rings.
 
Variant: Also available are \fun{GEN}{caract}{GEN A, long v} ($\fl=1$),
 \fun{GEN}{carhess}{GEN A, long v} ($\fl=2$), and \fun{GEN}{caradj}{GEN A,
 long v, GEN *pt}. In this last case, if \var{pt} is not \kbd{NULL},
 \kbd{*pt} receives the address of the adjoint matrix of $A$ (see
 \tet{matadjoint}), so both can be obtained at once.
