C-Name: charpoly0
Prototype: GDnD0,L,
Help: charpoly(A,{v=x},{flag=0}): det(v*Id-A)=characteristic polynomial of
 the matrix or polmod A. flag is optional and may be set to 1 (use
 Lagrange interpolation) or 2 (use Hessenberg form), 0 being the default

 \idx{characteristic polynomial}
 of $A$ with respect to the variable $v$, i.e.~determinant of $v*I-A$ if $A$
 is a square matrix. If $A$ is not a square matrix, it returns the
 characteristic polynomial of the map ``multiplication by $A$'' if $A$ is a
 scalar, in particular a polmod. E.g.~\kbd{charpoly(I) = x\pow2+1}.
 
 The value of $\fl$ is only significant for matrices. Let $n$ be the dimension
 of $A$.
 
 If $\fl=0$, the method used is essentially the same as for computing the
 adjoint matrix, i.e.~computing the traces of the powers of $A$. Assumes that
 $n!$ is invertible.
 
 If $\fl=1$, uses Lagrange interpolation which is usually the slowest method.
 Assumes that $n!$ is invertible.
 
 If $\fl=2$, uses the Hessenberg form. Assumes that the base ring is a field.
 This last variant is the fastest whenever coefficient explosion does not
 occur, e.g.~over a finite field or the reals. It is usually slower in other
 base rings.
 
 \syn{charpoly0}{A,v,\fl}, where $v$ is the variable number. Also available
 are the functions \funs{caract}{A,v} ($\fl=1$), \funs{carhess}{A,v}
 ($\fl=2$), and \funs{caradj}{A,v,\var{pt}} where, in this last case,
 \var{pt} is a \kbd{GEN*} which, if not equal to \kbd{NULL}, will receive
 the address of the adjoint matrix of $A$ (see \kbd{matadjoint}), so both
 can be obtained at once.
