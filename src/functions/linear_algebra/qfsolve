 matrix G.
Doc: Given a square matrix $G$ of dimension $n \geq 1$, solve over $\Q$ the
 quadratic equation $X^tGX = 0$. The matrix $G$ must have rational
 coefficients. The solution might be a single non-zero vector (vectorv) or a
 matrix (whose columns generate a totally isotropic subspace).

 If no solution exists, returns an integer, that can be a prime $p$ such that
 there is no local solution at $p$, or $-1$ if there is no real solution.
