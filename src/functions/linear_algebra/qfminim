Function: qfminim
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: qfminim0
Prototype: GDGDGD0,L,p
Help: qfminim(x,{b},{m},{flag=0}): x being a square and symmetric
 matrix representing a positive definite quadratic form, this function
 deals with the vectors of x whose norm is less than or equal to b,
 enumerated using the Fincke-Pohst algorithm. The function searches for
 the minimal non-zero vectors if b is omitted. The precise behaviour
 depends on flag. 0: seeks at most 2m vectors, result [N,M,mat] where
 N is the number of vectors found, M the maximum norm among these, and mat
 lists the vectors. 1: ignores m and returns the first vector whose norm is
 less than b. 2: as 0 but uses a more robust, slower implementation, valid for
  non integral quadratic forms
Doc: $x$ being a square and symmetric
 matrix representing a positive definite quadratic form, this function
 deals with the vectors of $x$ whose norm is less than or equal to $b$,
 enumerated using the Fincke-Pohst algorithm. The function searches for
 the minimal non-zero vectors if $b$ is omitted. The precise behaviour
 depends on $\fl$.
 
 If $\fl=0$ (default), seeks at most $2m$ vectors. The result is a
 three-component vector, the first component being the number of vectors
 found, the second being the maximum norm found, and the last vector is a
 matrix whose columns are the vectors found, only one being given for each
 pair $\pm v$ (at most $m$ such pairs). The vectors are returned in no
 particular order. In this variant, an explicit $m$ must be provided.
 
 If $\fl=1$, ignores $m$ and returns the first vector whose norm is less
 than $b$. In this variant, an explicit $b$ must be provided.
 
 In both these cases, $x$ is assumed to have integral entries. The
 implementation uses low precision floating point computations for maximal
 speed, which gives incorrect result when $x$ has large entries. (The
 condition is checked in the code and the routine will raise an error if
 large rounding errors occur.) A more robust, but much slower,
 implementation is chosen if the following flag is used:
 
 If $\fl=2$, $x$ can have non integral real entries. In this case, if $b$
 is omitted, the ``minimal'' vectors only have approximately the same norm.
 If $b$ is omitted, $m$ is an upper bound for the number of vectors that
 will be stored and returned, but all minimal vectors are nevertheless
 enumerated. If $m$ is omitted, all vectors found are stored and returned;
 note that this may be a huge vector! 
 
Variant: Also available are \fun{GEN}{minim}{GEN x, GEN b = NULL, GEN m =
 NULL} ($\fl=0$), \fun{GEN}{minim2}{GEN x, GEN b = NULL, GEN m = NULL}
 ($\fl=1$).
