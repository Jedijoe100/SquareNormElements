Function: setsearch
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: setsearch
Prototype: lGGD0,L,
Help: setsearch(x,y,{flag=0}): looks if y belongs to the set x. If flag is 0
 or omitted, returns 0 if it is not, otherwise returns the index j such that
 y==x[j]. If flag is non-zero, return 0 if y belongs to x, otherwise the
 index j where it should be inserted.
Doc: searches if $y$ belongs to the set
 $x$ (see \kbd{setisset}; $y$ is replaced by \kbd{Str}$(y)$ if it is not already a
 \typ{STR}). If it does and $\fl$ is zero or omitted, returns the
 index $j$ such that $x[j]=y$, otherwise returns 0. If $\fl$ is non-zero returns
 the index $j$ where $y$ should be inserted, and $0$ if it already belongs to $x$
 (this is meant to be used in conjunction with \kbd{listinsert}).

 This function works also if $x$ is a \emph{sorted} list (see \kbd{listsort})
 of \typ{LIST}s.
