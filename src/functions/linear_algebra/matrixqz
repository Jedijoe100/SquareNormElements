C-Name: matrixqz0
Prototype: GDG
Help: matrixqz(A,{p=0}): if p>=0, transforms the rational or integral mxn (m>=n)
 matrix A into an integral matrix with gcd of maximal determinants coprime to
 p. If p=-1, finds a basis of the intersection with Z^n of the lattice spanned
 by the columns of A. If p=-2, finds a basis of the intersection with Z^n of
 the Q-vector space spanned by the columns of A
Doc: $A$ being an $m\times n$ matrix in $M_{m,n}(\Q)$ with $m\ge n$, let
 $\text{Im}_\Q A$ (resp.~$\text{Im}_\Z A$) the $\Q$-vector space
 (resp.~the $\Z$-module) spanned by the columns of $A$. This function has
 varying behaviour depending on the sign of $p$:
 
 If $p \geq 0$, $A$ is assumed to have maximal rank $n$. The function returns
 a matrix $B\in M_{m,n}(\Z)$, with $\text{Im}_\Q B = \text{Im}_\Q A$,
 such that the GCD of all its $n\times n$ minors or rank $n$ is coprime to
 $p$; in particular, if $p = 0$ (default), this GCD is $1$.
 
 If $p=-1$, returns a basis of the lattice $\Z^n \cap \text{Im}_\Z A$.
 
 If $p=-2$, returns a basis of the lattice $\Z^n \cap \text{Im}_\Q A$.
