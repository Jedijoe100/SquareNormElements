Function: matrixqz

C-Name: matrixqz0
Prototype: GG
Help: matrixqz(x,p): if p>=0, transforms the rational or integral mxn (m>=n)
 matrix x into an integral matrix with gcd of maximal determinants equal to 1
 if p is equal to 0, not divisible by p otherwise. If p=-1, finds a basis of
 the intersection with Z^n of the lattice spanned by the columns of x. If
 p=-2, finds a basis of the intersection with Z^n of the Q-vector space
 spanned by the columns of x
Doc: $x$ being an $m\times n$ matrix with $m\ge n$
 with rational or integer entries, this function has varying behaviour
 depending on the sign of $p$:
 
 If $p\geq 0$, $x$ is assumed to be of maximal rank. This function returns a
 matrix having only integral entries, having the same image as $x$, such that
 the GCD of all its $n\times n$ subdeterminants is equal to 1 when $p$ is
 equal to 0, or not divisible by $p$ otherwise. Here $p$ must be a prime
 number (when it is non-zero). However, if the function is used when $p$ has
 no small prime factors, it will either work or give the message ``impossible
 inverse modulo'' and a non-trivial divisor of $p$.
 
 If $p=-1$, this function returns a matrix whose columns form a basis of the
 lattice equal to $\Z^n$ intersected with the lattice generated by the
 columns of $x$.
 
 If $p=-2$, returns a matrix whose columns form a basis of the lattice equal
 to $\Z^n$ intersected with the $\Q$-vector space generated by the
 columns of $x$.
