Function: matrixqz
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: matrixqz0
Prototype: GDG
Help: matrixqz(x,{p=0}): if p>=0, transforms the rational or integral mxn (m>=n)
 matrix x into an integral matrix with gcd of maximal determinants coprime to
 p. If p=-1, finds a basis of the intersection with Z^n of the lattice spanned
 by the columns of x. If p=-2, finds a basis of the intersection with Z^n of
 the Q-vector space spanned by the columns of x
Doc: $x$ being an $m\times n$ matrix with $m\ge n$ with rational or integer
 entries, this function has varying behaviour depending on the sign of $p$:
 
 If $p \geq 0$, $x$ is assumed to be of maximal rank $n$. The function
 returns a matrix having only integral entries, having the same $\Q$-image as
 $x$, such that the GCD of all its $n\times n$ subdeterminants is coprime to
 $p$ (hence equal to 1 when $p$ is equal to 0).
 
 If $p=-1$, this function returns a matrix whose columns form a basis of the
 lattice equal to $\Z^n$ intersected with the lattice generated by the
 columns of $x$.
 
 If $p=-2$, returns a matrix whose columns form a basis of the lattice equal
 to $\Z^n$ intersected with the $\Q$-vector space generated by the columns of
 $x$.
