Help: qfperfection(a): rank of matrix of xx~ for x minimal vectors of a gram
 matrix a
Doc: 
 $x$ being a square and symmetric matrix with
 integer entries representing a positive definite quadratic form, outputs the
 perfection rank of the form. That is, gives the rank of the family of the $s$
 symmetric matrices $v_iv_i^t$, where $s$ is half the number of minimal
 vectors and the $v_i$ ($1\le i\le s$) are the minimal vectors.
 
 As a side note to old-timers, this used to fail bluntly when $x$ had more
 than $5000$ minimal vectors. Beware that the computations can now be very
 lengthy when $x$ has many minimal vectors.
