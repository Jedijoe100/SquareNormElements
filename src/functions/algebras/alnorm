Help: alnorm(al,x): (reduced) norm of x.
Doc: Given an element \var{x} in \var{al}, computes its norm. If \var{al} is a table algebra output by \tet{altableinit}, returns the absolute norm of \var{x}, which is an element of $\F_p$ of~$\Q$; if \var{al} is a central simple algebra output by \tet{alinit}, returns the reduced norm of \var{x}, which is an element of the center of \var{al}.
