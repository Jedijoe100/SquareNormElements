C-Name: albasistoalg
Prototype: GG
Help: albasistoalg(al,x): transforms the column vector x on the integral basis of al into an element of al in algebraic form.
Doc: Given an element \var{x} in the central simple algebra \var{al} output by \tet{alinit}, transforms it to its algebraic representation in \var{al}.
 This is the inverse function of \tet{alalgtobasis}.
