C-Name: alalgtobasis
Prototype: GG
Help: alalgtobasis(al,x): transforms the element x of the algebra al into a column vector on the integral basis of al.
Doc: Given an element \var{x} in the central simple algebra \var{al} output by \tet{alinit}, transforms it to a column vector on the integral basis of \var{al}.
 This is the inverse function of \tet{albasistoalg}.
