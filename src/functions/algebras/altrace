Help: altrace(al,x): (reduced) trace of x.
Doc: Given an element \var{x} in \var{al}, computes its trace. If \var{al} is a table algebra output by \tet{altableinit}, returns the absolute trace of \var{x}, which is an element of $\F_p$ or~$\Q$; if \var{al} is the output of \tet{alinit}, returns the reduced trace of \var{x}, which is an element of the center of \var{al}.
