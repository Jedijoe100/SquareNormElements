Help: algord(al): stored order of the central simple algebra al.
Doc: Given an central simple algebra \var{al} output by \tet{alginit}, returns
 a $\Z$-basis of the order~${\cal O}_0$ stored in \var{al} with respect to the
 natural order in \var{al}. Returns a maximal order if one has been computed.
