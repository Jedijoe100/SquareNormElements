C-Name: ellsea
Prototype: GD0,U,
Help: ellsea(E,{tors=0}): computes the order of the group E(Fq)
 for the elliptic curve E, defined over a finite field,
 using SEA algorithm, with early abort for curves with non prime orders.
Doc: Let $E$ be an \var{ell} structure as output by \kbd{ellinit}, defined over
 a finite field $\F_q$.
 This function computes the order of the group $E(\F_q)$ using the SEA
 algorithm. The characteristic must be large enough.
 It is meant to be used when looking for curves having prime order:
 When $tors=1$ is set, the function will return $0$ as soon
 as it detects that the order has a small prime factor.
 When $tors>1$ is set, the function will return $0$ as soon
 as it detects that the order has a small prime factor not dividing
 $tors$.

 The availability of the \kbd{seadata} package will speed up the computation,
 and is strongly recommended when looking for curves having prime order.
