Help: ellcard(E,{p}): computes the order of the group E(Fp)
 Assume the equation is minimal at p.
Doc: computes the order of the group $E(\F_p)$
 The prime $p$ may be omitted if the curve
 was defined over $\F_p$ (\typ{INTMOD} coefficients) or $\Q_p$ (\typ{PADIC}
 coefficients). Otherwise the curve must be defined over $\Q$, and $p$ must
 be explicitly given. Over $\Q$ or $\Q_p$, the equation is assumed to be
 minimal at $p$; in this case, the reduction is allowed to be singular, and
 we return the order of the group of non-singular points.
Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{ellcard}{GEN E, GEN p} where $p$ is
 not \kbd{NULL}.
