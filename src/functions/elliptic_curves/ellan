Function: ellan
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: anell
Prototype: GL
Help: ellan(E,n): computes the first n Fourier coefficients of the
 L-function of the elliptic curve E (n<2^24 on a 32-bit machine).
Doc:
 computes the vector of the first $n$ $a_k$
 corresponding to the elliptic curve $E$. All comments in \kbd{ellak}
 description remain valid.
Variant: Also available is
  \fun{GEN}{anellsmall}{GEN e, long n}, which returns a \typ{VECSMALL}
 instead of a \typ{VEC}, saving on memory.
