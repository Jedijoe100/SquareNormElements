Function: elllseries
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: elllseries
Prototype: GGDGp
Help: elllseries(E,s,{A=1}): L-series at s of the elliptic curve E, where A
 a cut-off point close to 1.
Doc:
 $E$ being an elliptic curve over $\Q$ (not necessarily minimal), as output by
 \kbd{ellinit}, this computes the value of the L-series of $E$ at $s$.
 The optional parameter $A$ is a cutoff point for the integral, which must be
 chosen close to 1 for best speed. The result must be independent of $A$, so
 this allows some internal checking of the function.

 This function uses an $O(N^{1/2})$ algorithm, where $N$ is the conductor.
