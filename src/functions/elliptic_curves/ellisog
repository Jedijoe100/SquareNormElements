Help: ellisog(E, G, {only_compute_image = 0}, {x = 'x}, {y = 'y}): compute the image and isogeny corresponding to the quotient of E by the subgroup G.
Doc:
 Given an elliptic curve $E$, a finite subgroup $G$ of $E$ is given either
 as a generating point $P$ (for a cyclic $G$) or as a polynomial whose roots
 vanish on the $x$-coordinates of the non-zero elements of $G$ (general case
 and more efficient if available). This function returns the
 $[a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_6]$ invariants of the quotient elliptic curve $E/G$ and
 (if \var{only\_compute\_image} is zero (the default)) a vector of rational
 functions $[f, g, h]$ such that the isogeny $E \to E/G$ is given by $(x,y)
 \mapsto (f(x)/h(x)^2, g(x,y)/h(x)^3)$.

  The function \tet{ellapplyisog} can be
 used to apply the returned isogeny to particular points.
