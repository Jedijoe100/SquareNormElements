Help: ellisog(E, G, {only_compute_image = 0}, {x = 'x}, {y = 'y}): compute the image and isogeny corresponding to the quotient of E by the subgroup G.
Doc:
 Given an elliptic curve $E$ and subgroup $G$ of $E$ (given either as
 a generating point $P$ or as a polynomial whose roots vanish on the
 $x$-coordinates of the non-zero elements of $G$), return the quotient
 elliptic curve $E/G$ and (if \var{only\_compute\_image} is zero (the
 default)) a vector of rational functions $[f, g, h]$ such that
 the isogeny $E \to E/G$ is given by $(x,y) \mapsto (f(x)/h(x)^2,
 g(x,y)/h(x)^3)$.  The function \tet{ellapplyisog} can be used to apply
 the returned isogeny to particular points.
