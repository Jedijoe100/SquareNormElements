 gives 1 (i.e.~true) if the point $z$ is on
 the elliptic curve $E$, 0 otherwise. If $E$ or $z$ have imprecise coefficients,
 an attempt is made to take this into account, i.e.~an imprecise equality is
 checked, not a precise one. It is allowed for $z$ to be a vector of points
 in which case a vector (of the same type) is returned.
 
 \syn{ellisoncurve}{E,z}. Also available is \funs{oncurve}{E,z}
 which returns a \kbd{long} but does not accept vector of points.
