C-Name: ellwp0
Prototype: GDGD0,L,p
Help: ellwp(E,{z='x},{flag=0}):
 computes the value at z of the Weierstrass P function attached to the
 elliptic curve E as given by ellinit (alternatively, E can be
 given as a lattice [om1,om2]). Optional flag means 0 (default), compute only
 P(z), 1 compute [P(z),P'(z)].
Doc: Computes the value at $z$ of the Weierstrass $\wp$ function attached to
 the elliptic curve $E$ as given by \kbd{ellinit}; alternatively, $E$ can be
 given as a lattice $[\omega_1,\omega_2]$.

 Optional \fl\ means 0 (default): compute only $\wp(z)$, 1: compute
 $[\wp(z),\wp'(z)]$.

Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{ellwpseries}{GEN E, long v, long precdl}
 for the power series in variable $v$.
