Function: ellffinit
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: ellffinit
Prototype: GG
Help: ellffinit(x,g): x being a vector suitable for ellinit, and g a finite
 field element, return an ellff structure suitable for computation in the group
 E(K) where K is the definition field of g. The element g can also be a prime
 number, in which case K=Fp. This structure can be used in place where a small
 ell is allowed.  This structure contains the group structure and the
 factorization of the exponent.

 $x$ being a vector suitable for \tet{ellinit}, and $g$ a finite field element,
 return an \tet{ellff} structure suitable for computation in the group $E(K)$ where
 $K$ is the definition field of $g$. the element $g$ can also be a prime number,
 in which case $K=\F_p$. This structure can be used in functions that expect a small
 \kbd{ell}.  This structure contains the group structure and the factorization
 of the exponent.
