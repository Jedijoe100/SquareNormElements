Function: ellffinit
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: ellffinit
Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: ellffinit(x,g,{flag=0}): x being a vector suitable for ellinit, and g a
 finite
 field element, return an ellff structure suitable for computation in the group
 E(K) where K is the definition field of g. The element g can also be a prime
 number, in which case K=Fp. This structure can be used wherever a small
 ell is allowed; it contains the group structure. If flag=0 (defaut) the
 group order is fully factored; otherwise not. If flag=2, the group is assumed
 to be cyclic.

 $x$ being a vector suitable for \tet{ellinit}, and $g$ a finite field element,
 return an \tet{ellff} structure suitable for computation in the group $E(K)$ where
 $K$ is the definition field of $g$. the element $g$ can also be a prime number,
 in which case $K=\F_p$. This structure can be used in functions that expect a
 small \kbd{ell}. It contains the group structure as a product of cyclic
 groups. By default ($\fl = 0$), the group order is fully factored, which can
 be slow. If $\fl =2 $, the group is assumed to be cyclic.
