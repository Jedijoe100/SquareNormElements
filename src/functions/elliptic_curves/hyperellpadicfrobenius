Help: hyperellpadicfrobenius(Q,p,n): Q being a  rational polynomial of degree
 2*g+1, return the matrix of the Frobenius at p>=g in the standard
 basis of H^1_dR(E) to absolute p-adic precision p^n.

 Let $X$ be the curve defined by $y^2=Q(x)$, where  $Q$ is a polynomial of
 degree $2\*g+1$ over $\Q$ and $p\ge g$ a prime such that $X$ has good reduction
 at $p$ return the matrix of the Frobenius endomorphism $\varphi$ on the
 crystalline module $D_p(E) = \Q_p \otimes H^1_{dR}(E/\Q)$ with respect to the
 basis of the given model $(\omega, x\*\omega,\ldots,x^{g-1}\*\omega)$, where
 $\omega = dx/(2\*y)$ is the invariant differential.  The characteristic
 polynomial of $\varphi$ is the numerator of the zeta-function of the reduction
 of the curve $X$ modlo $p$. The matrix is computed to absolute $p$-adic
 precision $p^n$.
