Help: ellpadicfrobenius(E,p,n): matrix of the Frobenius at p>2 in the standard
 basis of D_p(E) to absolute p-adic precision p^n.
Doc: If $p>2$ is a prime and $E$ is a elliptic curve on $\Q$ with good
 reduction at $p$, return the matrix of the Frobenius endomorphism $\varphi$ on
 the crystalline module $D_p(E)= \Q_p \otimes H^1_{dR}(E/\Q)$ with respect to
 the basis of the given model $(\omega, \eta=x\*\omega)$, where $\omega$
 is the invariant differential $\omega=dx/(2\*y+a_1\*x+a_3)$.
 The characteristic polynomial of $\varphi$ is $x^2 - a_p\*x + p$.
 The matrix is computed to absolute $p$-adic precision $p^n$.
