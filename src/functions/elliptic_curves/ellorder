Function: ellorder
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: ellorder
Prototype: GGDG
Help: ellorder(E,z,{o}): order of the point z on the elliptic curve E over Q
 or Fp, 0 if non-torsion. The parameter o, if present, is a non-zero
 multiple of the order of z.
Doc:
 gives the order of the point $z$ on the elliptic
 curve $E$. If the curve is defined over $\Q$, return zero if the point has
 infinite order. The parameter o, if present, is a non-zero
 multiple of the order of z. For a curve defined over $\F_p$, it is very
 important to supply $o$ since its computation is very expensive and should
 only be done once, using \kbd{o = p+1-ellap(E,p)}, possibly using the
 \tet{seadata} package.
Variant: The obsolete form \fun{GEN}{orderell}{GEN e, GEN z} should no longer be
 used.
