C-Name: ellorder
Prototype: GGDG
Help: ellorder(E,z,{o}): order of the point z on the elliptic curve E over Q
 or a finite field, 0 if non-torsion. The parameter o, if present,
 is a non-zero multiple of the order of z (mandatory over non-prime finite
 fields).
Doc:
 gives the order of the point $z$ on the elliptic
 curve $E$. If the curve is defined over $\Q$, return zero if the point has
 infinite order. The parameter o, if present, is a non-zero
 multiple of the order of z. For a curve defined over $\F_p$, it is very
 important to supply $o$ since its computation is very expensive and should
 only be done once, using \kbd{o = p+1-ellap(E,p)}, possibly using the
 \tet{seadata} package; for a curve defined over a non-prime finite field,
 giving the order is \emph{mandatory} since no function is available yet to
 compute the cardinality or trace of Frobenius in that case.
Variant: The obsolete form \fun{GEN}{orderell}{GEN e, GEN z} should no longer be
 used.
