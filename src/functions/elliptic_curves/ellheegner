Help: ellheegner(E): return a rational non-torsion point on the elliptic curve E
 assumed to be of rank 1.
Doc: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over the rationals, assumed to be of (analytic) rank $1$.
 Returns a non-torsion point of the curve that is a small multiple of a generator.
 This uses the Heegner point method, described in Cohen GTM 239.
 The complexity is proportional to the product of the square root of the
 conductor and the heigth of the point.
