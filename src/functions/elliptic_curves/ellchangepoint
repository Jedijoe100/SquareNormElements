Help: ellchangepoint(x,v): change data on point or vector of points x on an
 elliptic curve according to v=[u,r,s,t]
Doc: 
 changes the coordinates of the point or
 vector of points $x$ using the vector \kbd{v=[u,r,s,t]}, i.e.~if $x'$ and
 $y'$ are the new coordinates, then $x=u^2x'+r$, $y=u^3y'+su^2x'+t$ (see also
 \kbd{ellchangecurve}).
