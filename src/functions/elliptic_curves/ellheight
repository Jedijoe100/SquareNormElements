Help: ellheight(E,x,{flag=2}): canonical height of point x on elliptic curve
 E defined by the vector E. flag is optional and selects the algorithm used
 to compute the archimedean local height. Its meaning is 0: use
 theta-functions, 1: use Tate's method, 2: use Mestre's AGM
Doc: 
 global \idx{N\'eron-Tate height} of
 the point $z$ on the elliptic curve $E$ (defined over $\Q$), given by a
 standard minimal integral model. $E$ must be an \kbd{ell} as output by
 \kbd{ellinit}. \fl selects the algorithm used to compute the archimedean
 local height. If $\fl=0$, this computation is done using sigma and
 theta-functions and a trick due to J. Silverman. If $\fl=1$, use Tate's $4^n$
 algorithm. If $\fl=2$, use Mestre's AGM algorithm. The latter is much faster
 than the other two, both in theory (converges quadratically) and in practice.
