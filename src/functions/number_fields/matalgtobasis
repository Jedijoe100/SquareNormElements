Function: matalgtobasis
Section: number_fields
C-Name: matalgtobasis
Prototype: GG
Help: matalgtobasis(nf,x): nfalgtobasis applied to every element of the
 matrix x
Doc: $\var{nf}$ being a number field in
 \kbd{nfinit} format, and $x$ a matrix whose coefficients are expressed as
 polmods in $\var{nf}$, transforms this matrix into a matrix whose
 coefficients are expressed on the integral basis of $\var{nf}$. This is the
 same as applying \kbd{nfalgtobasis} to each entry, but it would be dangerous
 to use the same name.
