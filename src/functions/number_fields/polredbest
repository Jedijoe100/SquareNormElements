Function: polredbest
Section: number_fields
C-Name: polredbest
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: polredbest(T,{flag=0}): reduction of the polynomial T (gives minimal
 polynomials only). If flag=1, gives also elements.
Doc: finds a polynomial with reasonably
 small coefficients defining the same number field as $T$.
 All $T$ accepted by \tet{nfinit} are also allowed here (e.g. non-monic
 polynomials, \kbd{nf}, \kbd{bnf}, \kbd{[T,Z\_K\_basis]}). Contrary to
 \tet{polredabs}, this routine runs in polynomial time, but it offers no
 guarantee as to the minimality of its result.

 If $\fl = 1$: outputs a two-component row vector $[P,a]$,  where $P$ is the
 default output and \kbd{Mod(a, P)} is a root of the original $T$.
 \bprog
 ? polredbest(x^4 + 8, 1)
 %1 = [x^4 + 2, Mod(x^3, x^4 + 2)]
 ? charpoly(%[2])
 %2 = x^4 + 8
