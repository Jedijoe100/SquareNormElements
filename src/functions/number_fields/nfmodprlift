Function: nfmodprlift
Section: number_fields
C-Name: nfmodprlift
Prototype: GGG
Help: nfmodprlift(nf,x,pr): lift x from residue field mod pr to nf
Doc: lift the \typ{FFELT} $x$ (from \tet{nfmodpr}) to the residue field
 modulo \var{pr}. Vectors and matrices are also supported. For polynomials,
 use \kbd{apply} and the present function.
