Help: nfdisc(T,{flag=0},{fa}): discriminant of the number field defined by
 the polynomial T using round 4. Optional args flag and fa are as in nfbasis.
Doc: \idx{field discriminant} of the number field defined by the integral,
 preferably monic, irreducible polynomial $T$. $\fl$ and \kbd{fa} are as
 in \kbd{nfbasis}.

 \item $\fl$ is a deprecated flag.

 \item \kbd{fa} is a vector of primes, or the matrix of a partial
 factorization of the discriminant of $T$ or a prime $p$. In that case, the
 function returns the discriminant of an order whose basis is given by
 \kbd{nfbasis(T,,fa)}, which need not be the maximal order, but its valuation
 at a prime entry in \kbd{fa} is the same as the valuation of the field
 discriminant.

 In particular, if \kbd{fa} is a prime $p$, return the $p$-adic discriminant
 of the maximal order of $\Z_p[X]/(T)$, as a power of $p$:
 \bprog
 ? nfdisc(x^2 + 6)
 %1 = -24
 ? nfdisc(x^2 + 6,, 2)
 %2 = 8
 ? nfdisc(x^2 + 6,, 3)
 %3 = 3
