Help: nfdisc(T,{flag=0},{fa}): discriminant of the number field defined by
 the polynomial T using round 4. Optional args flag and fa are as in nfbasis.
Doc: \idx{field discriminant} of the number field defined by the integral,
 preferably monic, irreducible polynomial $T$. $\fl$ and \kbd{fa} are exactly as
 in \kbd{nfbasis}. That is, \kbd{fa} is the matrix of a partial
 factorization of the discriminant of $T$ or a prime $p$, and binary digits
 of $\fl$ are as follows:

 1: assume that no square of a prime greater than \kbd{primelimit}
 divides the discriminant.

 2: use the round 2 algorithm, instead of the default \idx{round 4}. This
 should be slower except maybe for polynomials of small degree and
 coefficients.

 If \kbd{fa} is a prime $p$, return the $p$-adic discriminant of the maximal
 order of $\Z_p[X]/(T)$, as a power of $p$:
 \bprog
 ? nfdisc(x^2 + 6)
 %1 = -24
 ? nfdisc(x^2 + 6,, 2)
 %2 = 8
 ? nfdisc(x^2 + 6,, 3)
 %3 = 3

Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{nfdisc}{GEN T} ($\fl=0$).
