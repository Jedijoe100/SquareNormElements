Help: nfdisc(T,{listP}): discriminant of the number field defined by
 the polynomial T. Optional arg listP is as in nfbasis.
Doc: \idx{field discriminant} of the number field defined by the integral,
 preferably monic, irreducible polynomial $T(X)$. Returns the discriminant of
 the number field $\Q[X]/(T)$, using the Round $4$ algorithm.

 The optional argument \kbd{listP} is as in \kbd{nfbasis}: a vector of
 pairwise coprime integers (usually distinct primes), a factorization matrix,
 or a single integer. In that case, the function returns the discriminant of
 an order whose basis is given by \kbd{nfbasis(T,listP)}, which need not be
 the maximal order, and whose valuation at a prime entry in \kbd{listP} is the
 same as the valuation of the field discriminant.

 In particular, if \kbd{listP} is $[p]$ for a prime $p$, we can
 return the $p$-adic discriminant of the maximal order of $\Z_p[X]/(T)$,
 as a power of $p$, as follows:
 \bprog
 ? padicdisc(T,p) = p^valuation(nfdisc(T,[p]), p);
 ? nfdisc(x^2 + 6)
 %1 = -24
 ? padicdisc(x^2 + 6, 2)
 %2 = 8
 ? padicdisc(x^2 + 6, 3)
 %3 = 3
 @eprog

 \synt{nfdisc}{GEN T} (\kbd{listP = NULL}). Also available is
 \fun{GEN}{nfbasis}{GEN T, GEN *d, GEN listP = NULL}, which returns the order
 basis, and where \kbd{*d} receives the order discriminant.
