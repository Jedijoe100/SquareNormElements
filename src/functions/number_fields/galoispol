Description:
 galoispol(small):int               galoisnbpol($1)
 galoispol(small,):int              galoisnbpol($1)
 galoispol(small,,):int             galoisnbpol($1)
 galoispol(small,small,small):vec   galoispol($1, $2 ,$3)
Help: galoispol(a,{b},{s}): Query the galpol package for a polynomial with
 Galois group isomorphic to GAP4(a,b), totally real if s=1 (default) and
 totally complex if s=2.  The output is a vector [pol, den] where pol is the
 polynomial and den is the the common denominator of the conjugates expressed
 as a polynomial in a root of pol. If b and s are omitted, return the number of
 isomorphic class of groups of order a.
Doc: Query the galpol package for a polynomial with Galois group isomorphic to
 GAP4(a,b), totally real if $s=1$ (default) and totally complex if $s=2$. The
 output is a vector [\kbd{pol}, \kbd{den}] where \kbd{pol} is the polynomial and
 \kbd{den} is the the common denominator of the conjugates expressed as a
 polynomial in a root of \kbd{pol}, which can be passed as the optional argument
 of \tet{galoisinit} and \tet{nfgaloisconj} to speed up the computation as
 follow:

 \bprog
 V=galoispol(8,4,1);
 G=galoisinit(V[1],V[2])
 @eprog

 If $b$ and $s$ are omitted, return the number of isomorphic class of groups
 of order $a$.
Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{galoisnbpol}{long a} when $b$ and $s$
 are omitted.
