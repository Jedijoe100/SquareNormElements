Help: bnfmake(sbnf): transforms small sbnf as output by bnfinit with flag=3
 into a true big bnf
Doc: \var{sbnf} being a ``small $\var{bnf}$''
 as output by \kbd{bnfinit}$(x,3)$, computes the complete \kbd{bnfinit}
 information. The result is \emph{not} identical to what \kbd{bnfinit} would
 yield, but is functionally identical. The execution time is very small
 compared to a complete \kbd{bnfinit}. Note that if the default precision in
 \kbd{gp} (or $\var{prec}$ in library mode) is greater than the precision of the
 roots $\var{sbnf}[5]$, these are recomputed so as to get a result with
 greater accuracy.
 
 Note that the member functions are \emph{not} available for \var{sbnf}, you
 have to use \kbd{bnfmake} explicitly first.
