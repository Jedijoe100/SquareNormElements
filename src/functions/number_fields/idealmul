Function: idealmul
Section: number_fields
C-Name: idealmul0
Prototype: GGGD0,L,p
Help: idealmul(nf,x,y,{flag=0}): product of the two ideals x and y in the
 number field nf. If (optional) flag is non-nul, reduce the result
Description: 
 (gen, gen, gen, ?0):gen	idealmul($1, $2, $3)
 (gen, gen, gen, 1):gen:prec	idealmulred($1, $2, $3, prec)
 (gen, gen, gen, #small):gen	$"invalid flag in idealmul"
 (gen, gen, gen, small):gen:prec	idealmul0($1, $2, $3, $4, prec)
Doc: ideal multiplication of the ideals $x$ and $y$ in the number field
 \var{nf}. The result is a generating set for the ideal product with at most
 $n$ elements, and is in Hermite normal form if either $x$ or $y$ is in HNF
 or is a prime ideal as output by \kbd{idealprimedec}, and this is given
 together with the sum of the Archimedean information in $x$ and $y$ if both
 are given.
 
 If $\fl$ is non-zero, reduce the result using \kbd{idealred}.
Variant: Also available are \fun{GEN}{idealmul}{GEN nf, GEN x, GEN y}
 ($\fl=0$) or \fun{GEN}{idealmulred}{GEN nf, GEN x, GEN y, long prec}
 ($\fl\neq0$).
