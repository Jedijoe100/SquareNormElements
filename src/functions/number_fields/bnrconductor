C-Name: bnrconductor
Prototype: GDGDGDG
Help: bnrconductor(a1,{a2},{a3},{flag=0}): conductor f of the subfield of
 the ray class field given by a1,a2,a3 (see bnrdisc). flag is optional and
 can be 0: default, 1: returns [f, Cl_f, H], H subgroup of the ray class
 group modulo f defining the extension, 2: returns [f, bnr(f), H]
Doc: conductor $f$ of
 the subfield of a ray class field as defined by $[a_1,a_2,a_3]$ (see
 \kbd{bnr} at the beginning of this section).
 
 If $\fl = 0$, returns $f$.
 
 If $\fl = 1$, returns $[f, Cl_f, H]$, where $Cl_f$ is the ray class group
 modulo $f$, as a finite abelian group; finally $H$ is the subgroup of $Cl_f$
 defining the extension.
 
 If $\fl = 2$, returns $[f, \var{bnr}(f), H]$, as above except $Cl_f$ is
 replaced by a \kbd{bnr} structure, as output by $\tet{bnrinit}(,f,1)$.
