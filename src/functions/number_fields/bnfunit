Function: bnfunit
Section: number_fields
C-Name: buchfu
Prototype: G
Help: bnfunit(bnf): compute the fundamental units of the number field bnf
 output by bnfinit when they have not yet been computed (i.e. with flag=2)
Doc: $\var{bnf}$ being as output by
 \kbd{bnfinit}, outputs the vector of fundamental units of the number field.
 
 This function is mostly useless, since it will only succeed if
 \var{bnf} contains the units, in which case \kbd{bnf.fu} is recommended
 instead, or \var{bnf} was produced with \kbd{bnfinit(,,2)}, which is itself
 deprecated.
