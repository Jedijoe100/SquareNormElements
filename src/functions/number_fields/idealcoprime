C-Name: idealcoprime
Prototype: GGG
Help: idealcoprime(nf,x,y): gives an element b in nf such that b. x is an
 integral ideal coprime to the integral ideal y
Doc: given two integral ideals $x$ and $y$
 in the number field $\var{nf}$, finds a $\beta$ in the field, expressed on the
 integral basis $\var{nf}[7]$, such that $\beta\cdot x$ is an integral ideal
 coprime to $y$.
