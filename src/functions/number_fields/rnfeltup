Help: rnfeltup(rnf,x): expresses x (belonging to the base field) on the
 relative field.
Doc: $\var{rnf}$ being a relative number field extension $L/K$ as output by
 \kbd{rnfinit} and $x$ being an element of $K$, computes $x$ as an element of
 the absolute extension $L/\Q$ as a polynomial modulo the absolute equation
 \kbd{\var{rnf}.pol}.
