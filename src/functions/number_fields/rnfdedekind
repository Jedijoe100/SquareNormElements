Function: rnfdedekind
Section: number_fields
C-Name: rnfdedekind
Prototype: GGGD0,L,
Help: rnfdedekind(nf,pol,pr,{flag=0}): relative Dedekind criterion over the
 number field K, represented by nf, applied to the order O_K[X]/(P),
 modulo the prime ideal pr. P is assumed to be monic, irreducible, in O_K[X].
 Returns [max,basis,v], where basis is a pseudo-basis of the
 enlarged order, max is 1 iff this order is pr-maximal, and v is the
 valuation at pr of the order discriminant. If flag is set, just return 1 if
 the order is maximal, and 0 if not.
Doc: given a number field $K$ coded by $\var{nf}$ and a monic 
 polynomial $P\in \Z_K[X]$, irreducible over $K$ and thus defining a relative
 extension $L$ of $K$, applies \idx{Dedekind}'s criterion to the order
 $\Z_K[X]/(P)$, at the prime ideal \var{pr}. By default (\fl is 0 or
 ommitted), returns a 3-component vector $[\var{max}, \var{basis}, v]$:

 \item \var{basis} is a pseudo-basis of an enlarged order $O$ produced by 
 Dedekind's criterion, containing the original order $\Z_K[X]/(P)$
 with index a power of \var{pr}. Possibly equal to the original order.

 \item \var{max} is a flag equal to 1 if the enlarged order $O$ 
 could be proven to be \var{pr}-maximal and to 0 otherwise; it may still be
 maximal in the latter case if \var{pr} is ramified in $L$,

 \item $v$ is the valuation at \var{pr} of the order discriminant.

 If flag is non-zero, just return $1$ if the order $\Z_K[X]/(P)$ is
 \var{pr}-maximal, and $0$ if not. This is much faster than the default,
 since the enlargd order is not computed.



 \bprog
 ? nf = nfinit(y^2-3); P = x^3 - 2*y;
 ? pr3 = idealprimedec(nf,3)[1];
 ? rnfdedekind(nf, P, pr3)
 %2 = [1, [[1, 0, 0; 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]], 8]
 ? rnfdedekind(nf, P, pr3, 1)
 %3 = 1
 @eprog\noindent In this example, \kbd{pr3} is the ramified ideal above $3$,
 and the order generated by the cube roots of $y$ is already
 \kbd{pr3}-maximal. The order-discriminant has valuation $8$. On the other
 hand, the order is not maximal at the prime above 2:
 \bprog
 ? pr2 = idealprimedec(nf,2)[1];
 ? rnfdedekind(nf, P, pr2, 1)
 %5 = 0
 ? rnfdedekind(nf, P, pr2)
 %6 = [0, [[1, 0, 0; 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1], [[1, 0; 0, 1], [1, 0; 0, 1], [1, 1/2; 0, 1/2]]], 2]
 @eprog
 The enlarged order is not proven to be \kbd{pr2}-maximal yet. In fact, it
 is; it is in fact the maximal order:
 \bprog
 ? B = rnfpseudobasis(nf, P)
 %7 = [[1, 0, 0; 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, [1, 1/2; 0, 1/2]], [162, 0; 0, 162], -1]
 ? idealval(nf,B[3], pr2)
 %4 = 2
