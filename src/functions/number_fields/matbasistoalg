Function: matbasistoalg
Section: number_fields
C-Name: matbasistoalg
Prototype: GG
Help: matbasistoalg(nf,x): nfbasistoalg applied to every element of the
 matrix x
Doc: $\var{nf}$ being a number field in
 \kbd{nfinit} format, and $x$ a matrix whose coefficients are expressed as
 column vectors on the integral basis of $\var{nf}$, transforms this matrix
 into a matrix whose coefficients are algebraic numbers expressed as
 polmods. This is the same as applying \kbd{nfbasistoalg} to each entry, but
 it would be dangerous to use the same name.
