C-Name: bnrdisc0
Prototype: GDGDGD0,L,
Help: bnrdisc(A,{B},{C},{flag=0}): absolute or relative [N,R1,discf] of
 the field defined by A,B,C. [A,{B},{C}] is of type [bnr],
 [bnr,subgroup], [bnf, module] or [bnf,module,subgroup], where bnf is as
 output by bnfinit, bnr by bnrinit, and
 subgroup is the HNF matrix of a subgroup of the corresponding ray class
 group (if omitted, the trivial subgroup). flag is optional whose binary
 digits mean 1: give relative data; 2: return 0 if module is not the
 conductor
Doc: $A$, $B$, $C$
 defining a big ray number field $L$ over a ground field $K$ (see \kbd{bnr}
 at the beginning of this section for the
 meaning of $A$, $B$, $C$), outputs a 3-component row vector $[N,r_1,D]$,
 where $N$ is the (absolute) degree of $L$, $r_1$ the number of real places of
 $L$, and $D$ the discriminant of $L/\Q$, including sign (if $\fl=0$).

 If $\fl=1$, as above but outputs relative data. $N$ is now the degree of
 $L/K$, $r_1$ is the number of real places of $K$ unramified in $L$ (so that
 the number of real places of $L$ is equal to $r_1$ times the relative degree
 $N$), and $D$ is the relative discriminant ideal of $L/K$.

 If $\fl=2$, as the default case, except that if the modulus is not the
 exact conductor corresponding to the $L$, no data is computed and the result
 is $0$.

 If $\fl=3$, as case 2, but output relative data.
