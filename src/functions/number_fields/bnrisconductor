Function: bnrisconductor
Section: number_fields
C-Name: bnrisconductor
Prototype: lGDGDG
Help: bnrisconductor(a1,{a2},{a3}): returns 1 if the modulus is the
 conductor of the subfield of the ray class field given by a1,a2,a3 (see
 bnrdisc), and 0 otherwise. Slightly faster than bnrconductor if this is the
 only desired result
Doc: $a1$, $a2$, $a3$ represent
 an extension of the base field, given by class field theory for some modulus
 encoded in the parameters. Outputs 1 if this modulus is the conductor, and 0
 otherwise. This is slightly faster than \kbd{bnrconductor}.
 
 \syn{bnrisconductor}{a1,a2,a3} and the result is a \kbd{long}.
