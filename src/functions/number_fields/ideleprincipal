Function: ideleprincipal
Section: number_fields
C-Name: principalidele
Prototype: GGp
Help: ideleprincipal(nf,x): returns the principal idele generated by the
 algebraic number x in the number field nf
Doc: creates the principal idele
 generated by the algebraic number $x$ (which must be of type integer,
 rational or polmod) in the number field $\var{nf}$. The result is a
 two-component vector, the first being a one-column matrix representing the
 corresponding principal ideal, and the second being the vector with $r_1+r_2$
 components giving the complex logarithmic embedding of (the primitive part
 of) $x$.
