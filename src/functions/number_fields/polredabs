C-Name: polredabs0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: polredabs(x,{flag=0}): a smallest generating polynomial of the number
 field for the T2 norm on the roots, with smallest index for the minimal T2
 norm. flag is optional, whose binary digit mean 1: give the element whose
 characteristic polynomial is the given polynomial. 4: give all polynomials
 of minimal T2 norm (give only one of P(x) and P(-x)). 16: partial reduction.
Doc: finds one of the polynomial defining
 the same number field as the one defined by $x$, and such that the sum of the
 squares of the modulus of the roots (i.e.~the $T_2$-norm) is minimal.
 All $x$ accepted by \tet{nfinit} are also allowed here (e.g. non-monic
 polynomials, \kbd{nf}, \kbd{bnf}, \kbd{[x,Z\_K\_basis]}).

 \misctitle{Warning:} this routine uses an exponential-time algorithm to
 enumerate all potential generators, and may be exceedingly slow when the
 number field has many subfields, hence a lot of elements of small $T_2$-norm.
 E.g. do not try it on the compositum of many quadratic fields; in that case,
 use \tet{polred} instead.

 The binary digits of $\fl$ mean

 1: outputs a two-component row vector $[P,a]$, where $P$ is the default
 output and \kbd{Mod(a, P)} is a root of the original $x$.

 4: gives \emph{all} polynomials of minimal $T_2$ norm; of the two polynomials
 $P(x)$ and $\pm P(-x)$, only one is given.

 16: possibly use a suborder of the maximal order. The primes dividing the
 index of the order chosen are larger than \tet{primelimit} or divide integers
 stored in the \tet{addprimes} table. In that case it may happen that the
 output polynomial does not have minimal $T_2$ norm.
Variant: Instead of the above hardcoded numerical flags, one should use an 
 or-er combination of 

 \item \tet{nf_ORIG}: 
 
 \item \tet{nf_PARTIALFACT}: partial factorization of the
 discriminant, possibly work in a non-maximal order,
 
 \item \tet{nf_ALL}: give all polynomials of minimal norm,
 
 \item \tet{nf_ADDZK}: return [P,  (incompatible with \tet{nf_ALL}),
 
 \item \tet{nf_RAW}
