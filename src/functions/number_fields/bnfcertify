Function: bnfcertify
Section: number_fields
C-Name: certifybuchall
Prototype: lG
Help: bnfcertify(bnf): certify the correctness (i.e. remove the GRH) of the
 bnf data output by bnfinit.
Doc: $\var{bnf}$ being as output by
 \kbd{bnfinit}, checks whether the result is correct, i.e.~whether it is
 possible to remove the assumption of the Generalized Riemann
 Hypothesis\sidx{GRH}. It is correct if and only if the answer is 1. If it is
 incorrect, the program may output some error message, or loop indefinitely.
 You can check its progress by increasing the debug level.
