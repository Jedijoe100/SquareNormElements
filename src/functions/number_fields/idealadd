Help: idealadd(nf,x,y): sum of two ideals x and y in the number field
 defined by nf.
Doc: sum of the two ideals $x$ and $y$ in the
 number field $\var{nf}$. When $x$ and $y$ are given by $\Z$-bases, this does
 not depend on $\var{nf}$ and can be used to compute the sum of any two
 $\Z$-modules. The result is given in HNF.
