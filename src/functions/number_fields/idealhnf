Function: idealhnf
Section: number_fields
C-Name: idealhnf0
Prototype: GGDG
Help: idealhnf(nf,a,{b}): hermite normal form of the ideal a in the number
 field nf, whatever form a may have. If called as idealhnf(nf,a,b), the ideal
 is given as aZ_K+bZ_K in the number field K defined by nf
Doc: gives the \idx{Hermite normal form}
 matrix of the ideal $a$. The ideal can be given in any form whatsoever
 (typically by an algebraic number if it is principal, by a $\Z_K$-system of
 generators, as a prime ideal as given by \kbd{idealprimedec}, or by a
 $\Z$-basis).

 If $b$ is not omitted, assume the ideal given was $a\Z_K+b\Z_K$, where $a$
 and $b$ are elements of $K$ given either as vectors on the integral basis
 $\var{nf}[7]$ or as algebraic numbers.
Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{idealhermite}{GEN nf, GEN a}.
