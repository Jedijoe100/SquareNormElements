Help: nfalgtobasis(nf,x): transforms the algebraic number x into a column
 vector on the integral basis nf.zk
Doc: this is the inverse function of
 \kbd{nfbasistoalg}. Given an object $x$ whose entries are expressed as
 algebraic numbers in the number field $\var{nf}$, transforms it so that the
 entries are expressed as a column vector on the integral basis
 \kbd{\var{nf}.zk}.
