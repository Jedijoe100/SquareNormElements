Help: nfbasistoalg(nf,x): transforms the column vector x on the integral
 basis into an algebraic number
Doc: this is the inverse function of
 \kbd{nfalgtobasis}. Given an object $x$ whose entries are expressed on the
 integral basis \kbd{\var{nf}.zk}, transforms it into an object whose entries
 are algebraic numbers (i.e.~polmods).
