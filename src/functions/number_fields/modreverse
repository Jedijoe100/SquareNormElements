Help: modreverse(a): reverse polymod of the polmod a, if it exists
Doc: $a$ being a polmod $A(X)$ modulo $T(X)$, finds
 the ``reverse polmod'' $B(X)$ modulo $Q(X)$, where $Q$ is the minimal
 polynomial of $a$, which must be equal to the degree of $T$, and such that if
 $\theta$ is a root of $T$ then $\theta=B(\alpha)$ for a certain root $\alpha$
 of $Q$.
 
 This is very useful when one changes the generating element in algebraic
 extensions.
