C-Name: galoisapply
Prototype: GGG
Help: nfgaloisapply(nf,aut,x): Apply the Galois automorphism aut
 (polynomial or polmod) to the object x (element or ideal) in the number
 field nf.
Doc: $\var{nf}$ being a
 number field as output by \kbd{nfinit}, and \var{aut} being a \idx{Galois}
 automorphism of $\var{nf}$ expressed either as a polynomial or a polmod
 (such automorphisms being found using for example one of the variants of
 \kbd{nfgaloisconj}), computes the action of the automorphism \var{aut} on
 the object $x$ in the number field. $x$ can be a number field element,
 or an ideal (possibly extended). Because of possible confusion with elements
 and ideals, other vector or matrix arguments are forbidden.
