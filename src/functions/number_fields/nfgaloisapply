Help: nfgaloisapply(nf,aut,x): Apply the Galois automorphism sigma
 (polynomial or polymod) to the object x (element or ideal) in the number
 field nf
Doc: $\var{nf}$ being a
 number field as output by \kbd{nfinit}, and \var{aut} being a \idx{Galois}
 automorphism of $\var{nf}$ expressed either as a polynomial or a polmod
 (such automorphisms being found using for example one of the variants of
 \kbd{nfgaloisconj}), computes the action of the automorphism \var{aut} on
 the object $x$ in the number field. $x$ can be an element (scalar, polmod,
 polynomial or column vector) of the number field, an ideal (either given by
 $\Z_K$-generators or by a $\Z$-basis), a prime ideal (given as a 5-element
 row vector) or an idele (given as a 2-element row vector). Because of
 possible confusion with elements and ideals, other vector or matrix
 arguments are forbidden.
