C-Name: bnrstark
Prototype: GDGD0,L,p
Help: bnrstark(bnr,{subgroup},{flag=0}): bnr being as output by
 bnrinit(,,1), finds a relative equation for the class field corresponding to
 the module in bnr and the given congruence subgroup (the trivial subgroup if
 omitted) using Stark's units. The ground field and the class field must be
 totally real. flag is optional and may be set to 0 to obtain a reduced
 polynomial, 1 to obtain a non reduced polynomial, 2 to obtain an absolute
 polynomial and 3 to obtain the irreducible polynomial of the Stark unit, 0
 being default. If 4 is added to the value of flag, try hard to find the best
 modulus
