Doc: computes a two-element
 representation of the ideal $x$ in the number field $\var{nf}$, using a
 straightforward (exponential time) search. $x$ can be an ideal in any form,
 (including perhaps an Archimedean part, which is ignored) and the result is a
 row vector $[a,\alpha]$ with two components such that $x=a\Z_K+\alpha\Z_K$
 and $a\in\Z$, where $a$ is the one passed as argument if any. If $x$ is given
 by at least two generators, $a$ is chosen to be the positive generator of
 $x\cap\Z$.
 
 Note that when an explicit $a$ is given, we use an asymptotically faster
 method, however in practice it is usually slower.
