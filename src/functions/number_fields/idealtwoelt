Doc: computes a two-element
 representation of the ideal $x$ in the number field $\var{nf}$, combining a
 random search and an explicit approximation theorem. $x$ is an ideal
 in any form (including perhaps an Archimedean part, which is ignored) and the
 result is a row vector $[a,\alpha]$ with two components such that
 $x=a\Z_K+\alpha\Z_K$ and $a\in\Z$, where $a$ is the one passed as argument if
 any. If $x$ is given by at least two generators, $a$ is chosen to be the
 positive generator of $x\cap\Z$.

 Note that when an explicit $a$ is given, we must factor it and this may
 be costly. When $a$ is omitted, we use a fast lazy factorization of $x\cap
 \Z$, yielding an algorithm in randomized polynomial time (and generally
 much faster in practice).
