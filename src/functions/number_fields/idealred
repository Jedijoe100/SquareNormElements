Help: idealred(nf,I,{vdir=0}): LLL reduction of the ideal I in the number
 field nf along direction vdir, in HNF
Doc: \idx{LLL} reduction of
 the ideal $I$ in the number field \var{nf}, along the direction \var{vdir}.
 If \var{vdir} is present, it must be an $r1+r2$-component vector ($r1$ and
 $r2$ number of real and complex places of \var{nf} as usual).
 
 This function finds a ``small'' $a$ in $I$ (it is an LLL pseudo-minimum
 along direction \var{vdir}). The result is the Hermite normal form of
 the LLL-reduced ideal $r I/a$, where $r$ is a rational number such that the
 resulting ideal is integral and primitive. This is often, but not always, a
 reduced ideal in the sense of \idx{Buchmann}. If $I$ is an idele, the
 logarithmic embeddings of $a$ are subtracted to the Archimedean part.
 
 More often than not, a \idx{principal ideal} will yield the identity
 matrix. This is a quick and dirty way to check if ideals are principal,
 but it is not a necessary condition; a non-trivial result does not prove
 that the ideal is non-trivial in the class group. For guaranteed results,
 see \kbd{bnfisprincipal}, which requires the computation of a full
 \kbd{bnf} structure.
 
 Note that this is \emph{not} the same as the LLL reduction of the lattice
 $I$ since ideal operations are involved.
