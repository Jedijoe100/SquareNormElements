Help: galoisinit(pol,{den}): pol being a polynomial or a number field as
 output by nfinit defining a Galois extension of Q, compute the Galois group
 and all neccessary informations for computing fixed fields. den is optional
 and has the same meaning as in nfgaloisconj(,4)(see manual)
Description: 
 (gen, ?int):gal        galoisinit($1, $2)
Doc: computes the Galois group
 and all necessary information for computing the fixed fields of the
 Galois extension $K/\Q$ where $K$ is the number field defined by
 $\var{pol}$ (monic irreducible polynomial in $\Z[X]$ or
 a number field as output by \tet{nfinit}). The extension $K/\Q$ must be
 Galois with Galois group ``weakly'' super-solvable, see \tet{nfgaloisconj};
 returns 0 otherwise.
 
 This is a prerequisite for most of the \kbd{galois}$xxx$ routines. For
 instance:
 \bprog
 P = x^6 + 108;
 G = galoisinit(P);
 L = galoissubgroups(G);
 vector(#L, i, galoisisabelian(L[i],1))
 vector(#L, i, galoisidentify(L[i]))
 @eprog
 
 The output is an 8-component vector \var{gal}.
 
 $\var{gal}[1]$ contains the polynomial \var{pol}
 (\kbd{\var{gal}.pol}).
 
 $\var{gal}[2]$ is a three-components vector $[p,e,q]$ where $p$ is a
 prime number (\kbd{\var{gal}.p}) such that \var{pol} totally split
 modulo $p$ , $e$ is an integer and $q=p^e$ (\kbd{\var{gal}.mod}) is the
 modulus of the roots in \kbd{\var{gal}.roots}.
 
 $\var{gal}[3]$ is a vector $L$ containing the $p$-adic roots of
 \var{pol} as integers implicitly modulo \kbd{\var{gal}.mod}.
 (\kbd{\var{gal}.roots}).
 
 $\var{gal}[4]$ is the inverse of the Van der Monde matrix of the
 $p$-adic roots of \var{pol}, multiplied by $\var{gal}[5]$.
 
 $\var{gal}[5]$ is a multiple of the least common denominator of the
 automorphisms expressed as polynomial in a root of \var{pol}.
 
 $\var{gal}[6]$ is the Galois group $G$ expressed as a vector of
 permutations of $L$ (\kbd{\var{gal}.group}).
 
 $\var{gal}[7]$ is a generating subset $S=[s_1,\ldots,s_g]$ of $G$
 expressed as a vector of permutations of $L$ (\kbd{\var{gal}.gen}).
 
 $\var{gal}[8]$ contains the relative orders $[o_1,\ldots,o_g]$ of
 the generators of $S$ (\kbd{\var{gal}.orders}).
 
 Let $H$ be the maximal normal supersolvable subgroup of $G$, we have the
 following properties:
 
 \quad\item if $G/H\simeq A_4$ then $[o_1,\ldots,o_g]$ ends by
 $[2,2,3]$.
 
 \quad\item if $G/H\simeq S_4$ then $[o_1,\ldots,o_g]$ ends by
 $[2,2,3,2]$.
 
 \quad\item else $G$ is super-solvable.
 
 \quad\item for $1\leq i \leq g$ the subgroup of $G$ generated by
 $[s_1,\ldots,s_g]$ is normal, with the exception of $i=g-2$ in the
 second case and of $i=g-3$ in the third.
 
 \quad\item the relative order $o_i$ of $s_i$ is its order in the
 quotient group $G/\langle s_1,\ldots,s_{i-1}\rangle$, with the same
 exceptions.
 
 \quad\item for any $x\in G$ there exists a unique family
 $[e_1,\ldots,e_g]$ such that (no exceptions):
 
 -- for $1\leq i \leq g$ we have $0\leq e_i<o_i$
 
 -- $x=g_1^{e_1}g_2^{e_2}\ldots g_n^{e_n}$
 
 If present $den$ must be a suitable value for $\var{gal}[5]$.
