C-Name: bnfcompress
Prototype: G
Help: bnfcompress(bnf): converts bnf to a much smaller sbnf, containing the
 same information. Use bnfinit(sbnf) to recover a true bnf.
Doc: computes a compressed version of \var{bnf} (from \tet{bnfinit}), a
 ``small Buchmann's number field'' (or \var{sbnf} for short) which contains
 enough information to recover a full $\var{bnf}$ vector very rapidly, but
 which is much smaller and hence easy to store and print. Calling
 \kbd{bnfinit} on the result recovers a true \kbd{bnf}, in general different
 from the original. Note that an \tev{snbf} is useless for almost all
 purposes besides storage, and must be converted back to \tev{bnf} form
 before use; for instance, no \kbd{nf*}, \kbd{bnf*} or member function
 accepts them.
