Function: ideallist
Section: number_fields
C-Name: ideallist0
Prototype: GLD4,L,
Help: ideallist(nf,bound,{flag=4}): vector of vectors L of all idealstar of
 all ideals of norm<=bound. If (optional) flag is present, its binary digits
 are toggles meaning 1: give generators; 2: output [L,U], where L is as
 before, and U is a vector of vector of zinternallogs of the units; 4: give
 only the ideals and not the idealstar
