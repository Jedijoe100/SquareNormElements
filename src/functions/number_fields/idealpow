Function: idealpow
Section: number_fields
C-Name: idealpow0
Prototype: GGGD0,L,p
Help: idealpow(nf,x,k,{flag=0}): k-th power of the ideal x in HNF in the
 number field nf. If (optional) flag is non-null, reduce the result
Doc: computes the $k$-th power of
 the ideal $x$ in the number field $\var{nf}$. $k$ can be positive, negative
 or zero. The result is NOT reduced, it is really the $k$-th ideal power, and
 is given in HNF.
 
 If $\fl$ is non-zero, reduce the result using \kbd{idealred}. Note however
 that this is NOT the same as as $\kbd{idealpow}(\var{nf},x,k)$ followed by
 reduction, since the reduction is performed throughout the powering process.
 
 The library syntax corresponding to $\fl=0$ is
 \funs{idealpow}{\var{nf},x,k}. If $k$ is a \kbd{long}, you can use
 \funs{idealpows}{\var{nf},x,k}. Corresponding to $\fl=1$ is
 \funs{idealpowred}{\var{nf},vp,k,\var{prec}}, where $\var{prec}$ is a
 \kbd{long}.
