Help: nfroots({nf},x): roots of polynomial x belonging to nf (Q if
 omitted) without multiplicity
Doc: roots of the polynomial $x$ in the
 number field $\var{nf}$ given by \kbd{nfinit} without multiplicity (in $\Q$
 if $\var{nf}$ is omitted). $x$ has coefficients in the number field (scalar,
 polmod, polynomial, column vector). The main variable of $\var{nf}$ must be
 of lower priority than that of $x$ (see \secref{se:priority}). However if the
 coefficients of the number field occur explicitly (as polmods) as
 coefficients of $x$, the variable of these polmods \emph{must} be the same as
 the main variable of $t$ (see \kbd{nffactor}).
