Function: bnrdisclist
Section: number_fields
C-Name: bnrdisclist0
Prototype: GGDGD0,L,
Help: bnrdisclist(bnf,bound,{arch},{flag=0}): gives list of discriminants of
 ray class fields of all conductors up to norm bound, where the ramified
 Archimedean places are given by arch (unramified at infinity if arch is
 void), in a long vector format. If (optional) flag is present and non-null,
 give arch all the possible values. Supports the alternative syntax
 bnrdisclist(bnf,list), where list is as output by ideallist or ideallistarch
 (with units)
