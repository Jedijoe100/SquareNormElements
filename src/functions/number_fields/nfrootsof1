C-Name: rootsof1
Prototype: G
Help: nfrootsof1(nf): number of roots of unity and primitive root of unity
 in the number field nf
Doc: computes the number of roots of unity
 $w$ and a primitive $w$-th root of unity (expressed on the integral basis)
 belonging to the number field $\var{nf}$. The result is a two-component
 vector $[w,z]$ where $z$ is a column vector expressing a primitive $w$-th
 root of unity on the integral basis \kbd{\var{nf}.zk}.
