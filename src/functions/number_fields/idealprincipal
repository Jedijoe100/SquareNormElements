Function: idealprincipal
Section: number_fields
C-Name: principalideal
Prototype: GG
Help: idealprincipal(nf,x): returns the principal ideal generated by the
 algebraic number x in the number field nf
Doc: creates the principal ideal generated by the algebraic number $x$ in the
 number field $\var{nf}$. The result is a one-column matrix.

 For the converse problem, testing whether an ideal is principal and
 finding a generator, see \kbd{bnfisprincipal}. However, this requires
 a \kbd{bnf} structure. \sidx{principal ideal}

 FIXME: this function is useless since all ideal-related functions already
 accept number field elements as ideals, and it returns an ideal in a
 non-standard format (which should be a square matrix in HNF).
 It will disappear in future releases.
