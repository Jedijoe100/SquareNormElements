Function: bnfclgp
Section: number_fields
C-Name: classgrouponly
Prototype: GDGp
Help: bnfclgp(P,{tech=[]}): compute the class group of the number field
 defined by the polynomial P. If P is a non-zero integer, it is interpreted
 as a quadratic discriminant. See manual for details about tech
Doc: as \kbd{bnfinit}, but only outputs \kbd{bnf.clgp}, i.e.~the class group.
