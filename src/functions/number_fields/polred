Function: polred
Section: number_fields
C-Name: polred0
Prototype: GD0,L,DG
Help: polred(x,{flag=0},{fa}): reduction of the polynomial x (gives minimal
 polynomials only). Second and third args are optional. The following binary
 digits of flag are significant 1: partial reduction, 2: gives also elements.
 fa, if present, contains the complete factorization matrix of the
 discriminant
Doc: finds polynomials with reasonably
 small coefficients defining subfields of the number field defined by $x$.
 One of the polynomials always defines $\Q$ (hence is equal to $x-1$),
 and another always defines the same number field as $x$ if $x$ is irreducible.
 All $x$ accepted by \tet{nfinit} are also allowed here (e.g. non-monic
 polynomials, \kbd{nf}, \kbd{bnf}, \kbd{[x,Z\_K\_basis]}).
 
 The following binary digits of $\fl$ are significant:
 
 1: possibly use a suborder of the maximal order. The primes dividing the
 index of the order chosen are larger than \tet{primelimit} or divide integers
 stored in the \tet{addprimes} table.
 
 2: gives also elements. The result is a two-column matrix, the first column
 giving the elements defining these subfields, the second giving the
 corresponding minimal polynomials.
 
 If $fa$ is given, it is assumed that it is the two-column matrix of the
 factorization of the discriminant of the polynomial $x$.
 
 \syn{polred0}{x,\fl,fa}, where an omitted $fa$ is coded by \kbd{NULL}. Also
 available are \funs{polred}{x} and \funs{factoredpolred}{x,fa}, both
 corresponding to $\fl=0$.
