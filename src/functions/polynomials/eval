Help: eval(x): evaluation of x, replacing variables by their value
Doc: replaces in $x$ the formal variables by the values that
 have been assigned to them after the creation of $x$. This is mainly useful
 in GP, and not in library mode. Do not confuse this with substitution (see
 \kbd{subst}).
 
 If $x$ is a character string, \kbd{eval($x$)} executes $x$ as a GP
 command, as if directly input from the keyboard, and returns its
 output. For convenience, $x$ is evaluated as if
 \kbd{strictmatch} was off. In particular, unused characters at the end of
 $x$ do not prevent its evaluation:
 \bprog
 ? eval("1a")
 % 1 = 1

Variant: Also available are \fun{GEN}{poleval}{GEN q, GEN x},
 \fun{GEN}{qfeval}{GEN q, GEN x}, and \fun{GEN}{hqfeval}{GEN q, GEN x} to
 evaluate $q$ at $x$, where $q$ is respectively assumed to be a polynomial, a
 quadratic form (a symmetric matrix), or an Hermitian form (a Hermitian
 complex matrix).
