Prototype: GLLD0,L,
Help: padicfields(p, m, d, {flag=0}): vector of polynomials generating all the extensions 
 of degree m and discriminant p^d of the field of p-adic rational numbers (or all possible 
 discriminants if d < 0). flag is optional, and can be 0: default, 1: return also the 
 ramification index, the residual degree and the valuation of the discriminant, or 2: return 
 only the number of extensions.
Doc: vector of polynomials generating all the extensions of degree \var{m} and discriminant $p^d$
 of the field $\Bbb{Q}_p$ of $p$-adic rational numbers (or all possible discriminants if $\var{d} < 0$). 
 The list is minimal in the sense that two different polynomials generate non-isomorphic extensions.
 In particular, the number of polynomials is the number of classes of isomorphic extensions. Note that 
 any root of these polynomials is in fact the sum of an uniformizer and a generator of the residual
 field of the field it defines. In particular, its powers always generate the ring of $p$-adic 
 integers of this field. 
 
 If $\fl = 1$, for each polynomial $pol$ return a vector $[pol, e, f, d]$ where $e$ is the ramification 
 index, $f$ the residual degree and $d$ the valuation of the discriminant, or 2: return only the number 
 of extensions.
