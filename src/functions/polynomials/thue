Help: thue(tnf,a,{sol}): solve the equation P(x,y)=a, where tnf was created
 with thueinit(P), and sol, if present, contains the solutions of Norm(x)=a
 modulo units in the number field defined by P. If tnf was computed without
 assuming GRH (flag 1 in thueinit), the result is unconditional.
Doc: returns all solutions of the equation
 $P(x,y)=a$ in integers $x$ and $y$, where \var{tnf} was created with
 $\kbd{thueinit}(P)$. If present, \var{sol} must contain the solutions of
 $\Norm(x)=a$ modulo units of positive norm in the number field
 defined by $P$ (as computed by \kbd{bnfisintnorm}). If there are infinitely
 many solutions, an error will be issued.

 If the result is conditional on the GRH, a Warning is printed. Otherwise, the
 result is unconditional, barring bugs. For instance, here's how to solve the
 Thue equation $x^{13} - 5y^{13} = - 4$:
 \bprog
 ? tnf = thueinit(x^13 - 5);
 ? thue(tnf, -4)
 %1 = [[1, 1]]
 @eprog
 Hence, the only solution is $(x,y) = (1,1)$, and the result is
 unconditional. On the other hand:
 \bprog
 ? tnf = thueinit(x^3-2*x^2+3*x-17);
 ? thue(tnf, -15)
 *** thue: Warning: Non trivial conditional class group.
 *** May miss solutions of the norm equation.
 %2 = [[1, 1]]
 @eprog
 This time the result is conditional. All results computed using this tnf
 are likewise conditional, \emph{except} for a right-hand side of $\pm 1$.
 The above result is in fact correct, so we did not just disprove the GRH:
 \bprog
 ? tnf = thueinit(x^3-2*x^2+3*x-17, 1 /*unconditionnal*/);
 ? thue(tnf, -15)
 %4 = [[1, 1]]
 @eprog
 Note that reducible or non-monic polynomials are allowed:
 \bprog
 ? tnf = thueinit((2*x+1)^5 * (4*x^3-2*x^2+3*x-17), 1);
 ? thue(tnf, 128)
 %2 = [[-1, 0], [1, 0]]
 @eprog\noindent Reducible polynomials are in fact much easier to handle, but
 sometimes
