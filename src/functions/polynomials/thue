Help: thue(tnf,a,{sol}): solve the equation P(x,y)=a, where tnf was created
 with thueinit(P), and sol, if present, contains the solutions of Norm(x)=a
 modulo units in the number field defined by P. If tnf was computed without
 assuming GRH (flag 1 in thueinit), the result is unconditional.
Doc: solves the equation
 $P(x,y)=a$ in integers $x$ and $y$, where \var{tnf} was created with
 $\kbd{thueinit}(P)$. \var{sol}, if present, contains the solutions of
 $\Norm(x)=a$ modulo units of positive norm in the number field
 defined by $P$ (as computed by \kbd{bnfisintnorm}). If the
 result is conditional (on the GRH or some heuristic strengthening),
 a Warning is printed. Otherwise, the result is unconditional, barring bugs.
 For instance, here's how to solve the Thue equation $x^{13} - 5y^{13} = - 4$:

 \bprog
 ? tnf = thueinit(x^13 - 5);
 ? thue(tnf, -4)
 %1 = [[1, 1]]
 @eprog
 Hence, the only solution is $x = 1$, $y = 1$ and the result is
 unconditional. On the other hand:

 \bprog
 ? tnf = thueinit(x^3-2*x^2+3*x-17);
 ? thue(tnf, -15)
 *** thue: Warning: Non trivial conditional class group.
 *** May miss solutions of the norm equation.
 %2 = [[1, 1]]
 @eprog
 This time the result is conditional. All results computed using this tnf
 are likewise conditional, \emph{except} for a right-hand side of $\pm 1$.
