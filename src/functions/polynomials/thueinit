C-Name: thueinit
Prototype: GD0,L,p
Help: thueinit(P,{flag=0}): initialize the tnf corresponding to P, that will
 be used to solve Thue equations P(x,y) = some-integer. If flag is non-zero,
 certify the result unconditionnaly. Otherwise, assume GRH (much faster of
 course).
Doc: initializes the \var{tnf}
 corresponding to $P$. It is meant to be used in conjunction with \tet{thue}
 to solve Thue equations $P(x,y) = a$, where $a$ is an integer. If $\fl$ is
 non-zero, certify the result unconditionally. Otherwise, assume \idx{GRH},
 this being much faster of course.

 \emph{If} the conditional computed class group is trivial \emph{or} you are
 only interested in the case $a = \pm1$, then results are unconditional
 anyway. So one should only use the flag is \kbd{thue} prints a Warning (see
 the example there).
