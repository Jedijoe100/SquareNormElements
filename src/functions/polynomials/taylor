C-Name: tayl
Prototype: GnP
Help: taylor(x,y): taylor expansion of x with respect to the main variable
 of y
Doc: Taylor expansion around $0$ of $x$ with respect to
 the simple variable $y$. $x$ can be of any reasonable type, for example a
 rational function. The number of terms of the expansion is transparent to the
 user in GP, but must be given as a second argument in library mode.
 
 \syn{tayl}{x,y,n}, where the \kbd{long} integer $n$ is the desired number of
 terms in the expansion.
