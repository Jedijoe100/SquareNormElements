Function: polrootsreal
Section: polynomials
C-Name: realroots
Prototype: Gp
Help: polrootsreal(x): real roots of the polynomial x with rational
 coefficients, using Uspensky's method.
Doc: real roots of the polynomial \var{x} with rational
 coefficients, multiple roots being included only once. The roots are given
 to a relative accuracy of \kbd{realprecision}.

 The algorithm used is a modification of Uspensky's method (relying on
 Descartes's rule of sign), following Rouillier and Zimmerman ``Efficient
 isolation of a polynomial real roots''
 (\url{http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00072518/}. Barring bugs, it is guaranteed
 to converge and to give the roots to the required accuracy.
