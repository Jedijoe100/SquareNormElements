Function: polrootsreal
Section: polynomials
C-Name: realroots
Prototype: GDGp
Help: polrootsreal(x, {ab}): real roots of the polynomial x with rational
 coefficients, using Uspensky's method. In interval ab = [a,b] if present.
Doc: real roots of the polynomial \var{x} with rational
 coefficients, multiple roots being included only once. The roots are given
 to a relative accuracy of \kbd{realprecision}. If argument \var{ab} is
 present, it must be a vector $[a,b]$ with two components (of type
 \typ{INT}, \typ{FRAC} or \typ{INFINITY}) and we restrict to roots belonging
 to that closed interval.

 The algorithm used is a modification of Uspensky's method (relying on
 Descartes's rule of sign), following Rouillier and Zimmerman ``Efficient
 isolation of a polynomial real roots''
 (\url{http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00072518/}. Barring bugs, it is guaranteed
 to converge and to give the roots to the required accuracy.
