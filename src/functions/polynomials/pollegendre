Function: pollegendre
Section: polynomials
C-Name: pollegendre_eval
Prototype: LDG
Help: pollegendre(n,{a='x}): legendre polynomial of degree n evaluated at a
Doc: $n^{\text{th}}$ \idx{Legendre polynomial} evaluated at $a$ (\kbd{'x} by
 default). Even though the end result has coefficients in $\Z[1/2]$, the
 routine assumes further that $n!$ is invertible in the base ring, i.e.
 \bprog
 ? pollegendre(10, Mod(2,5))
  *** pollegendre: impossible inverse modulo: Mod(0, 5).
 ? pollegendre(10, 2+O(5^3))
 %2 = 3 + O(5)
 @eprog\noindent As seen above, $p$-adics to a high enough precision should
 enable you to bypass this restriction.

Variant: The variant \fun{GEN}{pollegendre}{long n, long v} returns the $n$-th
 Legendre polynomial in variable $v$.
