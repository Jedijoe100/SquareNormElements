Help: intformal(x,{v}): formal integration of x with respect to v, or to the
 main variable of x if v is omitted.
Doc: \idx{formal integration} of $x$ with respect to the variable $v$ (wrt.
 the main variable if $v$ is omitted). Since PARI cannot represent
 logarithmic or arctangent terms, any such term in the result will yield an
 error:

 @eprog
 The argument $x$ can be of any type. When $x$ is a rational function, we
 assume that the base ring is an integral domain of characteristic zero.
