Function: polhensellift
Section: polynomials
C-Name: polhensellift
Prototype: GGGL
Help: polhensellift(x, y, p, e): lift the factorization y of x modulo p to a
 factorization modulo p^e using Hensel lift. The factors in y must be
 pairwise relatively prime modulo p
Doc: given a prime $p$, an integral
 polynomial $x$ whose leading coefficient is a $p$-unit, a vector $y$ of
 integral polynomials that are pairwise relatively prime modulo $p$, and whose
 product is congruent to $x$ modulo $p$, lift the elements of $y$ to
 polynomials whose product is congruent to $x$ modulo $p^e$.
