Function: polsubcyclo
Section: polynomials
C-Name: polsubcyclo
Prototype: LLDn
Help: polsubcyclo(n,d,{v=x}): finds an equation (in variable v) for the d-th
 degree subfields of Q(zeta_n). Output is a polynomial or a vector of
 polynomials is there are several such fields, or none.
Doc: gives polynomials (in variable
 $v$) defining the sub-Abelian extensions of degree $d$ of the cyclotomic
 field $\Q(\zeta_n)$, where $d\mid \phi(n)$.
 
 If there is exactly one such extension the output is a polynomial, else it is
 a vector of polynomials, eventually empty.
 
 To be sure to get a vector, you can use \kbd{concat([],polsubcyclo(n,d))}
 
 The function \tet{galoissubcyclo} allows to specify more closely which sub-Abelian extension should be computed.
 
 \syn{polsubcyclo}{n,d,v}, where $n$, $d$ and $v$ are \kbd{long}s and $v$ is a
 variable number. When $(\Z/n\Z)^*$ is cyclic, you can use
 \funs{polsubcyclo}{n,d,v}, where $n$, $d$ and $v$ are \kbd{long} and $v$ is a
 variable number.
