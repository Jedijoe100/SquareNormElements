Function: polresultant
Section: polynomials
C-Name: polresultant0
Prototype: GGDnD0,L,
Help: polresultant(x,y,{v},{flag=0}): resultant of the polynomials x and y,
 with respect to the main variables of x and y if v is omitted, with respect
 to the variable v otherwise. flag is optional, and can be 0: default,
 assumes that the polynomials have exact entries (uses the subresultant
 algorithm), 1 for arbitrary polynomials, using Sylvester's matrix, or 2:
 using a Ducos's modified subresultant algorithm
Doc: resultant of the two
 polynomials $x$ and $y$ with exact entries, with respect to the main
 variables of $x$ and $y$ if $v$ is omitted, with respect to the variable $v$
 otherwise. The algorithm assumes the base ring is a domain.
 
 If $\fl=0$, uses the \idx{subresultant algorithm}.
 
 If $\fl=1$, uses the determinant of Sylvester's matrix instead (here $x$ and
 $y$ may have non-exact coefficients).
 
 If $\fl=2$, uses Ducos's modified subresultant algorithm. It should be much
 faster than the default if the coefficient ring is complicated (e.g
 multivariate polynomials or huge coefficients), and slightly slower
 otherwise.

 If you also need the $u$ and $v$ such that $x*u + y*v = res(x,y)$,
 use the \tet{bezoutres} function.
