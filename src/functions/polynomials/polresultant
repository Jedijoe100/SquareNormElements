Function: polresultant
Section: polynomials
C-Name: polresultant0
Prototype: GGDnD0,L,
Help: polresultant(x,y,{v},{flag=0}): resultant of the polynomials x and y,
 with respect to the main variables of x and y if v is omitted, with respect
 to the variable v otherwise. flag is optional, and can be 0: default,
 assumes that the polynomials have exact entries (uses the subresultant
 algorithm), 1 for arbitrary polynomials, using Sylvester's matrix, or 2:
 using a Ducos's modified subresultant algorithm
Doc: resultant of the two
 polynomials $x$ and $y$ with exact entries, with respect to the main
 variables of $x$ and $y$ if $v$ is omitted, with respect to the variable $v$
 otherwise. The algorithm assumes the base ring is a domain.
 
 If $\fl=0$, uses the \idx{subresultant algorithm}.
 
 If $\fl=1$, uses the determinant of Sylvester's matrix instead (here $x$ and
 $y$ may have non-exact coefficients).
 
 If $\fl=2$, uses Ducos's modified subresultant algorithm. It should be much
 faster than the default if the coefficient ring is complicated (e.g
 multivariate polynomials or huge coefficients), and slightly slower
 otherwise.
 
 \syn{polresultant0}{x,y,v,\fl}, where $v$ is a \kbd{long} and an omitted $v$
 is coded as $-1$. Also available are \funs{subres}{x,y} ($\fl=0$) and
 \funs{resultant2}{x,y} ($\fl=1$).
