Function: polcoeff
Section: polynomials
C-Name: polcoeff0
Prototype: GLDn
Help: polcoeff(x,s,{v}): coefficient of degree s of x, or the s-th component
 for vectors or matrices (for which it is simpler to use x[]). With respect
 to the main variable if v is omitted, with respect to the variable v
 otherwise
Description: 
 (pol, 0):gen:copy      constant_term($1)
 (gen, small, ?var):gen polcoeff0($1, $2, $3)
Doc: coefficient of degree $s$ of the
 polynomial $x$, with respect to the main variable if $v$ is omitted, with
 respect to $v$ otherwise. Also applies to power series, scalars (polynomial
 of degree $0$), and to rational functions provided the denominator is a
 monomial.
 
 \syn{polcoeff0}{x,s,v}, where $v$ is a \kbd{long} and an omitted $v$ is coded
 as $-1$. Also available is \funs{truecoeff}{x,v}.
