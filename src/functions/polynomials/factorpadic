C-Name: factorpadic0
Prototype: GGLD0,L,
Help: factorpadic(pol,p,r): p-adic factorization of the polynomial pol
 to precision r.
Doc: $p$-adic factorization
 of the polynomial \var{pol} to precision $r$, the result being a
 two-column matrix as in \kbd{factor}. The factors are normalized so that
 their leading coefficient is a power of $p$. $r$ must be strictly larger than
 the $p$-adic valuation of the discriminant of \var{pol} for the result to
 make any sense. The method used is a modified version of the \idx{round 4}
 algorithm of \idx{Zassenhaus}.
