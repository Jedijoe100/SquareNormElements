Function: subst
Section: polynomials
C-Name: gsubst
Prototype: GnG
Help: subst(x,y,z): in expression x, replace the variable y by the
 expression z.
Doc: replace the simple variable $y$ by the argument $z$ in the ``polynomial''
 expression $x$. Every type is allowed for $x$, but if it is not a genuine
 polynomial (or power series, or rational function), the substitution will be
 done as if the scalar components were polynomials of degree zero. In
 particular, beware that:

 \bprog
 ? subst(1, x, [1,2; 3,4])
 %1 =
 [1 0]

 [0 1]

 ? subst(1, x, Mat([0,1]))
 ***   forbidden substitution by a non square matrix
 @eprog\noindent
 If $x$ is a power series, $z$ must be either a polynomial, a power
 series, or a rational function.

 Use the function \kbd{substvec} to replace several variables at once,
 or the function \kbd{substpol} to replace a polynomial expression.
