C-Name: poldegree
Prototype: lGDn
Help: poldegree(x,{v}): degree of the polynomial or rational function x with
 respect to main variable if v is omitted, with respect to v otherwise.
 For scalar x, return 0 is x is non-zero and a negative number otherwise
Description: 
 (pol):small:parens	lg($1)-3
 (gen):small	degree($1)
 (gen, var):small	poldegree($1, $2)
Doc: degree of the polynomial $x$ in the main
 variable if $v$ is omitted, in the variable $v$ otherwise.
 
 The degree of $0$ is a fixed negative number, whose exact value should
 not be used. The degree of a non-zero scalar is $0$. Finally, when $x$ is
 a non-zero polynomial or rational function, returns the ordinary degree
 of $x$. Raise an error otherwise.
 
 \syn{poldegree}{x,v}, where $v$ and the result are \kbd{long}s (and an
 omitted $v$ is coded as $-1$). Also available is \funs{degree}{x}, which is
 equivalent to \kbd{poldegree($x$,-1)}.
