Help: sumnummoninit({asymp},{w},{n0 = 1}): initialize tables for Monien summation of a series with positive terms.
Doc: initialize tables for Monien summation of a series $\sum_{n\geq n_0}
 f(n)$ where $f(1/z)$ has a complex analytic continuation in a (complex)
 neighbourhood of the segment $[0,1]$.

 By default, assume that $f(n) = O(n^{-2})$ and has a non-zero asymptotic
 expansion
 $$f(n) = \sum_{i\geq 2} a_i / n^i$$
 at infinity. Note that the sum starts at $i = 2$! The argument \kbd{asymp}
 allows to specify different expansions:

 \item a real number $\alpha > 1$ means
  $$f(n) = \sum_{i\geq 1} a_i / n^\alpha$$
 (Now the summation starts at $1$.)

 \item a vector $[\alpha,\beta]$ of reals, where we must have $\alpha > 0$
 and $\alpha + \beta > 1$ to ensure convergence, means that
  $$f(n) = \sum_{i\geq 1} a_i / n^{\alpha i + \beta}$$
 Note that $\kbd{asymp} = [\alpha, \alpha]$ is equivalent to $\alpha$.

 The argument $w$ is used to sum expressions of the form
 $$ \sum_{n\geq n_0} f(n) w(n),$$
 for varying $f$ \emph{as above}, and fixed weight function $w$, where we
 further assume that the auxiliary sums
 $$g_w(m) = \sum_{n\geq n_0} w(n) / n^{\alpha m + \beta} $$
 converges for all $m\geq 1$. Note that for non-negative integers $k$,
 and weight $w(n) = (\log n)^k$, the function $g_w(m) = \zeta^{(k)}(\alpha m +
 \beta)$ has a simple expression; for general weights, $g_w$ is
 computed using \kbd{sumnumdelta}.

 The following variants are available

 \item an integer $k \geq 0$, to code $w(n) = (\log n)^k$. Currently,
 only the cases $k = 0,1$ are implemented;

 \item a \typ{CLOSURE} computing the values $w(n)$, where we
 assume the $w(n) = O(n^\epsilon)$ for all $\epsilon > 0$;

 \item a vector $[w, \kbd{fast}]$, where $w$ is a closure as above
 and \kbd{fast} is a scalar;
 we assume that $w(n) = O(n^{\kbd{fast}+\epsilon})$;

 \item a vector $[w, \kbd{oo}]$, where $w$ is a closure as above
 we assume that $w(n)$ decreases exponentially. Note that in this case,
 \kbd{sumnummon} is provided for completeness and comparison purposes only:
 one of \kbd{suminf} or \kbd{sumpos} should be preferred in practice.

 The cases where $w$ is a closure are the only ones where $n_0$ is taken into
 account and stored in the result. The subsequent call to \kbd{sumnummon}
 \emph{must} use the same value.
