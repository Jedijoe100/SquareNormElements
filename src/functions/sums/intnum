Function: intnum
Section: sums
C-Name: intnum0
Prototype: V=GGEDGp
Help: intnum(X=a,b,s,{tab}): numerical integration of s from a to b with 
 respect to X. Plus/minus infinity is coded as [+1]/ [-1]. Finally tab is
 either omitted (let the program choose the integration step), a positive
 integer m (choose integration step 1/2^m), or data precomputed with intnuminit.
