Function: sumdiv
Section: sums
C-Name: divsum
Prototype: GVE
Help: sumdiv(n,X,expr): sum of expression expr, X running over the divisors
 of n
Doc: sum of expression \var{expr} over the positive divisors of $n$.
 
 Arithmetic functions like \tet{sigma} use the multiplicativity of the
 underlying expression to speed up the computation. In the present version
 \vers, there is no way to indicate that \var{expr} is multiplicative in
 $n$, hence specialized functions should be preferred whenever possible.
