Function: intfourierexp
Section: sums
C-Name: intfourexp0
Prototype: V=GGGEDGp
Help: intfourierexp(X=a,b,z,expr,{tab}): numerical integration from a to b
 of exp(-2*I*Pi*z*X)*expr(X) from a to b, where a, b, and tab are as in intnum.
 This is the ordinary Fourier transform if a=-infty and b=+infty. Note the
 minus sign.
Doc: numerical
 integration of $\var{expr}(X)\exp(-2i\pi zX)$ from $a$ to $b$, in other words
 Fourier transform (from $a$ to $b$) of the function represented by
 \var{expr}. Note the minus sign. Endpoints $a$ and $b$ are coded as in
 \kbd{intnum}, and are not necessarily at infinity but if they are,
 oscillations (i.e. $[[\pm1],\alpha I]$) are forbidden.
