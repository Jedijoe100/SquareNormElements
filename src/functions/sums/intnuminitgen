C-Name: intnuminitgen0
Prototype: VGGED0,L,p
Help: intnuminitgen(t,a,b,phi,{m=0}): initialize tables for
 integrations from a to b using abscissas phi(t) and weights ph'(t). Note that
 there is no equal sign after the variable name t since t always goes from
 -infty to +infty, but it is ph(t) which goes from a to b.
Doc: initialize tables for integrations from $a$ to $b$ with

 \item abscissas $\phi(t)$ (\kbd{phi(t)}), assumed monotonic with
 $\lim_{-\infty} \phi = a$ and $\lim_{+\infty} \phi = b$;

 \item weights $\phi'(t)$, estimated via \kbd{derivnum}.

 Note that there is no equal sign after the variable name $t$ since $t$
 always goes from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$, but it is $\phi(t)$ which goes from
 $a$ to $b$.

 If $a = -b$, whether finite or infinite, we assume that $\phi$ is \emph{odd}.

 The behaviour at $a$ or $b$ of the function to be integrated \emph{must not}
 be specified as usual in \tet{intnum}).
