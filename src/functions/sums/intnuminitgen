Prototype: VGGED0,L,D0,L,p
Help: intnuminitgen(t,a,b,ph,{m=0}): initialize tables for
 integrations from a to b using abscissas ph(t) and weights ph'(t). Note that
 there is no equal sign after the variable name t since t always goes from
 -infty to +infty, but it is ph(t) which goes from a to b, and this is not
 checked.
