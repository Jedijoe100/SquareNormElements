Function: sumnum
Section: sums
C-Name: sumnum0
Prototype: V=GGEDGD0,L,p
Help: sumnum(X=a,sig,s,{tab},{flag=0}): numerical summation of s from 
 X = ceiling(a) to +infinity. sig is either a scalar or a two-component vector
 coded as in intnum, and the scalar part is larger than all the real parts of 
 the poles of s. Uses intnum, hence tab is as in intnum. If flag is nonzero,
 assumes that the function to be summed satisfies conj(f(z))=f(conj(z)), and
 then up to twice faster.
