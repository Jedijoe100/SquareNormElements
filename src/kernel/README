There is a different directory for each value of "$asmarch". Each contain
a file Makefile.SH, to be included in the general Makefile. It contains
rules for creating headers and object files in the build directory.

The list of object files is given by "$kernel" (default: "kernel mp mpinl")

* Level 0 symbols, defined in object file kernel.o, are :
  overflow hiremainder
  addll addllx subll subllx shiftl shiftlr mulll addmul
  divll
  bfffo
If no assembler implementation is available the definitions are in
none/ (level0.h, divll.h, bfffo.h). Otherwise, in $asmarch/ (level0.s, level0.h)

* Inline Level 1 symbols, defined in mpinl.o: the definitions are in
none/level1.h (see there). Inlining may or may not be possible, but a symbol
must be defined in mpinl.o in any case.

* Non-Inline Level 1 symbols, defined in mp.o: the definitions are in
various *.c files in none/ and gmp/ concatenated into $objdir/mp.c.
