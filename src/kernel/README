There is a different directory for each value of "$asmarch". Each contain
a file Makefile.SH, to be included in the general Makefile. It contains
rules for creating headers and object files in the build directory.

The list of object files is given by "$kernel" (default: "mp mpinl")

* Level 0 symbols, in object file mpinl.o, are :
  overflow hiremainder
  addll addllx subll subllx mulll addmul
  divll
  bfffo
If no assembler implementation is available the definitions are in
none/ (asm0.h, divll.h, bfffo.h). Otherwise, in $asmarch/asm0.h

* Inline Level 1 symbols, in mpinl.o: the definitions are in
none/level1.h (see there). Inlining may or may not be possible, but a symbol
must be defined in mpinl.o in any case.

FIXME: asm0.h/asm1.h should be renamed according to the above.

* Non-Inline Level 1 symbols, defined in mp.o: the definitions are in
various *.c files in none/ and gmp/ concatenated into $objdir/mp.c.
