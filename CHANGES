Done for version 2.4.0 (released ??/??/2006):
  Fixed
    1- typo in remiimul: wrong result in a "failsafe" branch (hardly ever
       taken). May affect modular powering /Fp if p >> 10^1300 [#457]
       Also affects the gmp kernel, for p >> 10^5800.
    2- rare accuracy problem in bnfinit
       P=x^8-787856*x^6+232721637848*x^4-30546112988506688*x^2+1503204734505922286224;
       setrand(1974190693); bnfinit(P) --> non invertible matrix in gauss

  Changed
    1- moved cgiv to inline kernel
