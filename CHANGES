Bug numbers refer to the BTS at http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/Bugs/

Done for version 2.6.0 (released ??/??/20??):

  Fixed
    1- Euclidean chains were confused by t_POLs with t_INTMOD/t_POLMOD coeffs
       [ because a 0 polynomial could have lg() == 3 ]
    2- numerical instability in ellheightoo [#1204]
    3- Flm_gauss(m, smallish p): fix and enable the OK_ulong switch [ faster ]
    4- remi2n didn't allow negative arguments [native kernel] [#1215]

  Changed
    1- mathnf: swapped flag 3 and 5.
    2- allow ellinit([a4,a6]) [#1213]
    3- ellinit(... singular curve ...]): return [] instead of raising an error
    4- GP set elements are no longer converted to t_STR (requiring "eval" to
       recover the underlying object). Arbitrary GENs can be stored in a set.
    5- moved Odos/* to relevant src/systems subdirectory
    6- removed Odos directory

  Added
    1- mathnf for matrices over K[X] [#41]
BA  2- GP function ellheegner
BA  3- asm inline macro addllx8 for faster addition.
BA  4- Library function FpXQ_autpowers

  Removed
    1- dropped DOS support
