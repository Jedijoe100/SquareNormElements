This file documents access to the CVS server, which is intended for PARI
developers or [alpha|beta]-testers who want the very latest bleeding edge
release. The CVS sources are guaranteed to compile cleanly and to pass the
bench suite on (one of) the administrator(s)'s machine(s), that's all. They
may otherwise contain severe bugs. Stable releases will be made available
on a regular basis using the customary method (a message to pari-announce).


First connection to the anonymous CVS server:

  cvs -d :pserver:cvs@megrez.math.u-bordeaux.fr:/home/megrez/cvsroot login
  Hit return when asked for a password

  cvs -d :pserver:cvs@megrez.math.u-bordeaux.fr:/home/megrez/cvsroot checkout pari

This last command will create a local copy of the distribution from the
repository (directory 'pari'). From now on, you can 'cd' to this pari
directory and use any cvs command without the -d argument, as long as you
remain there (or in a subdirectory). Password won't be required again. You
can also build pari in the usual way (see INSTALL). You can update your
local copy at any time using 'cvs update', which will put you in synch with
the repository.

If you modify your local copy, you won't be able to commit your changes
using anonymous access. Use 

  'cvs diff'     [with flag -c if your local diff supports it]

Then send the output to the pari-dev mailing list with a short description
of what you've done [or to pari@math.u-bordeaux.fr if you're not subscribed
to pari-dev].

If you plan to do that on a regular basis (which would be nice :-), send a
note to pari-dev, telling what kind of development work you're interested in,
and ask for the rights to modify the repository directly. Once this is
granted, you'll be able to log in as 'cvsadmin' (the CVS administrator)
instead of 'cvs' (CVS user) as described above and you'll be able to use 'cvs
commit' directly.


NOTES:
1) you can speed up file transfers by using cvs -z9 (transfer files in
compressed format), e.g 'cvs -z9 update' if you've missed a lot of patches,
or 'cvs -z9 checkout' for the initial checkout. This requires that GNU gzip
be in your path.

2) once you've run Configure, some files/directory will be created in the
local copy which are not under CVS control (only the master files are).
These are

  O<OS>-<arch>/
  O<OS>-<arch>.dbg/
  O<OS>-<arch>.prf/
  Makefile.O<OS>-<arch>
  Makefile.O<OS>-<arch>.dbg
  Makefile.O<OS>-<arch>.prf
  examples/Makefile.<OS>-<arch>
  doc/Makefile
  doc/gphelp
  doc/paricfg.tex
  doc/*.[aux | dvi | idx | log | ps | std | toc]
  emacs/pari.el

After a global 'cvs diff', or 'cvs status', you can safely ignore all
messages pertaining to them (e.g "? doc/Makefile").

3) 'cvs diff' gives you the difference between your local copy and the
sources they were based on, not with the current state of the repository.
Use 'cvs diff -D now'
