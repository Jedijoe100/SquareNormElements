PARI/GP was originally written (1987) in the Laboratoire A2X, Universite
Bordeaux I (France) by Christian Batut, Dominique Bernardi, Henri Cohen
and Michel Olivier. Karim Belabas maintains PARI/GP since 1995.

A great number of people have contributed code through the successive
improvements which eventually resulted in the present version of PARI/GP.
Even more people, too numerous to list, contributed by testing, reporting
bugs or suggesting improvements, Igor Schein foremost among them.

We would like to thank them all here.
